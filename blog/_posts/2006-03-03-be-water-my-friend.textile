description: I was watching a documentary about martial arts movies and caught an interview with Bruce Lee. The following quote of his rang in my head like gospel:Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way round or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.

I was watching a documentary about martial arts movies and caught an interview with Bruce Lee. The following quote of his rang in my head like gospel:

<blockquote>Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way round or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.

Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend.</blockquote>

This is my new theme. I'm carrying this around in my head and savoring it like hard candy for the soul.
