Perhaps it was all the news footage of Chelsea Clinton's wedding, but I have become obsessed with the notion of getting a mini pre-fab home in the country. Sara had shown me this site a while ago: "http://www.weehouse.com":http://www.weehouse.com and I can't stop looking at the images. A little house upstate to retreat to...ahh...sounds perfect. 

Now I need to figure out where I'm going to get the money for such a house.

My favorites are the McGlasson and the Marfa, by the way.
