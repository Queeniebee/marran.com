description: As many of you may know, I keep an herb garden in our backyard. Most of the time, I let the plants do what plants do and just try to make sure they're watered enough. Last year, I lost a few plants with my cavalier attitude to gardening. And my tomato production seemed a little low. This year, I decided to do it right. I bought several seeds, got a seed starting kit, and started growing seeds on the top floor.

As many of you may know, I keep an herb garden in our backyard. Most of the time, I let the plants do what plants do and just try to make sure they're watered enough. Last year, I lost a few plants with my cavalier attitude to gardening. And my tomato production seemed a little low. This year, I decided to do it right. I bought several seeds, got a seed starting kit, and started growing seeds on the top floor.

As you can see, they're all growing! This is the first wave. It includes, a lot of basil, tomatoes, peppers, thyme, mint, and parseley. I also have seeds for tomatillos, cilantro, and pumpkin, but they either start later or go directly in the ground. I actually read the instructions on the seed package. Amazing what a difference that made!
