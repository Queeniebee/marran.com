description: One of the last big renovations was the Bollywood Room and my office. As I'm sitting here writing this, it's hard to believe that this room sat full of junk for years. It's hard to remember that the carpet was ripped up by the door from Gogo trying to escape. It feels like my own personal cave. I never want to leave.

One of the last big renovations was the Bollywood Room and my office. As I'm sitting here writing this, it's hard to believe that this room sat full of junk for years. It's hard to remember that the carpet was ripped up by the door from Gogo trying to escape. It feels like my own personal cave. I never want to leave.

So, after give tours of the house and listening to everyone <em>rave</em> about the X-Men Bathroom, David decided to trust me on my plan for a Bollywood Room. Not because he liked the idea, but because he would do anything to stop people gushing about the X-Men Bathroom. I think he realized that the Bollywood Room had the potential to be the coolest room in the house.

It's close...but there's no beating the X-Men Bathroom. No Way.
