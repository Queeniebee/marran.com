description: Last night we had our first performance of our Charleston dance routine. It's been a long 8 weeks of rehearsal and there were times when I was worried that I'd never get the choreography. Then shortly after I got the choreography, I was worried I'd never get it up to the speed of the music. I'm actually at the point now where everything seems pretty manageable, and it's a matter of everything being sharp and tight.

Last night we had our first performance of our Charleston dance routine. It's been a long 8 weeks of rehearsal and there were times when I was worried that I'd never get the choreography. Then shortly after I got the choreography, I was worried I'd never get it up to the speed of the music. I'm actually at the point now where everything seems pretty manageable, and it's a matter of everything being sharp and tight.

Technically, last night's performance was called a dress rehearsal, but there was an audience of about 30 people. I seemed to be the only with jitters, but I think some of the other troupe members were not letting on how much their nerves were affecting them.

The performance went great. The parts that I saw of it looked really hot. And the audience went wild. They started cheering about halfway through the piece and by the end, there was consistent cheering and applauding and by the time we hit our final pose, the audience went wild.

Here's a shot of the final pose. My face is blocked, but I'm the one in a center with a female on my back.

And one final photo, we bowed as we were being showered with applause.
