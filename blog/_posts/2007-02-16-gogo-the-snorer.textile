description: I never knew that dogs could snore so loudly. I'm in the kitchen watching TV. At one point, the sound got a little soft. Not silent, just soft. I heard the gentle sound of snoring. It was Gogo who was in the other room, underneath the piano, curled up asleep. I thought snoring was just for dogs with shortened snouts - like pugs or bulldogs. I'll have to go wake her up and tell he how cute she is.
