So in the meantime, here's a video of our latest dance performance. Yours truly is the one shaking the finger at the dancer playing the little girl in the beginning. Then I re-emerge later.

This was a great performance. I had a lot of fun because there's a bit more acting, the choreography was not quite as demanding, and it had a creepy Halloween theme to it.
