description: I've been seeing the new iPod commercials a lot lately. The new song is quite catchy. I thought I'd do a search and see who the band is. I'm never surprised when I don't know current bands - I stopped being impressed with popular music a long time ago. I barely ever recognize the music acts on Saturday Night Live anymore.

I've been seeing the new iPod commercials a lot lately. The new song is quite catchy. I thought I'd do a search and see who the band is. I'm never surprised when I don't know current bands - I stopped being impressed with popular music a long time ago. I barely ever recognize the music acts on Saturday Night Live anymore.

Anyway, the band playing in the iPod commercials is "The Fratellis". And get this - their albums aren't even released in the U.S. yet! There's an EP of some of their songs that you can get on iTunes, but if you want the full CD, you have to wait until March. It's a band from Scotland and they've apparently hit it big out there. According to a reviewer on Amazon, all of their songs are ridiculously catchy. I pre-ordered the CD on Amazon.
How aggressively cool is Apple to select a song for their new iPod commercials using a CD that isn't even released in the U.S. yet? It's almost frightening.
