description: In August of 2004, there was a blackout on much of the Eastern seaboard of the United States. We were in Manhattan when it hit. At first it was a bit exciting, but as the evening approached and we realized we'd have to go through a hot August night without even a fan, I lost my taste for this little adventure.

<p>Just about every other block, someone would open their car doors and leave their radio on loud enough for other people to hear the news.</p>
