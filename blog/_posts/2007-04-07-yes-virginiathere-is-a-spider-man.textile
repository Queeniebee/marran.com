description: There's a certain part of my brain that is eight years old, is happy to be eight years old, and will always be eight years old. For instance, I am eternally grateful that I was eight years old when Star Wars came out. If I had to be born at any time, I'm glad that I was alive to be a kid when those first three Star Wars movies came out.

There's a certain part of my brain that is eight years old, is happy to be eight years old, and will always be eight years old. For instance, I am eternally grateful that I was eight years old when Star Wars came out. If I had to be born at any time, I'm glad that I was alive to be a kid when those first three Star Wars movies came out.



I have had another one of those moments. For April 30th - May 6th, New York City is having <a target="_blank" href="http://spider-manweeknyc.com">Spider-Man Week in NYC</a>. Be still my geeky heart.



My friend Sara originally told me the news. I simply replied "Every day is Spider-Man day in my head."



There are banners all over town and in the subways advertising it. Yes, it's a big corporate marketing event. But at least it's better than tried to get everyone talking about say, some new fried hamburger from McDonald's.



I've looked at the list of events and sadly I will have to steal someone's kids to participate in most of them. As an adult, I just don't think I can run through the Bronx Zoo looking for clues to Spider-Man's location. Is this why people have kids?



I'll definitely have to get a shot of the giant inflatable Spider-Man at the Sony store.



And the New York Public Library's exhibit of never-before-displayed, original Spider-Man comic books at the Humanities and Social Sciences Library sounds somewhat age appropriate.



Really, I'm just hoping to catch glimpses of people in Spider-Man costumes throughout the week.
