description: I'm working on an exercise to better understand the various editorial passes one takes on a script. Let's put them down in two categories:	Preparing for myself	Preparing for distributionI can easily identify elements of the second one:	Finalize page and panel breakdowns	Expand character descriptions and panel descriptionsThe first one's a little harder. It's based on good content.	Subtext - are characters clearly communicating subtext?

I'm working on an exercise to better understand the various editorial passes one takes on a script. Let's put them down in two categories:
<ul>
	<li>Preparing for myself</li>
	<li>Preparing for distribution</li>
</ul>
I can easily identify elements of the second one:
<ul>
	<li>Finalize page and panel breakdowns</li>
	<li>Expand character descriptions and panel descriptions</li>
</ul>
The first one's a little harder. It's based on good content.
<ul>
	<li>Subtext - are characters clearly communicating subtext?</li>
	<li>Desperation - are characters truly going for what they want?</li>
	<li>Parallels - do lines have matching parallels?</li>
	<li>Transitions - does each scene transition smoothly</li>
</ul>
