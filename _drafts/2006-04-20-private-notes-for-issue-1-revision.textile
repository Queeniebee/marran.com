  The goal is to make this sell-able or pitch-able. Therefore, ew need to stop stepping around the edges of things. Don't let things unfold slowly, bang it into place. The goal of any good horror movie is to show that the interactions of the characters is the true horror.

The goal is to make this sell-able or pitch-able. Therefore, ew need to stop stepping around the edges of things. Don't let things unfold slowly, bang it into place. The goal of any good horror movie is to show that the interactions of the characters is the true horror.
<ul>
	<li>Rename it "The Guinea Pigs"</li>
	<li>Start and end it with Dr. Lamont watching outside of the NYU building. We have to know that this is a controlled experiment from the very beginning.</li>
	<li>Possibly show the drug deal to Peter's friend at some point. Perhaps at the beginning, perhaps at the very end.</li>
	<li>When Joe tries to warn Amy that a monster is in the building, they try to escape out the window. Dr. Lamont sees the unfortunate result of that from the outside.</li>
	<li>Forget Officer Bradley as a major character. He's gone after the first episode.</li>
	<li>Let Dr. Lamont explain what went on with the experiments. Let him spill all the beans.</li>
</ul>
So that leaves the second issue as a little dry. We see more of Dr. Lamont with Audrey. There has to be a watcher. Perhaps Peter sees the watcher from the balcony. The issue ends with the watcher telling Dr. Lamont that the second one has been a success.
