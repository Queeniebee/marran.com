David and I are in Prague (which would explain the inevitable typos - the keys on the keyboard are often not where you expect them to be). He has a conference. I love Prague. I would never pass up an opportunity to visit. There's a wonderful mix of old European extravagance and communist era solitude.

We skipped the boat tour with the other anesthesiologists and had dinner last night, just the two of us, at a place called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.palffy.cz/en/index.htm">Palffy Palac</a>. The building is literally a palace. We climbed a tall and wide marble staircase to get to the restaurant. During communism, the palace was used to stock propaganda. Now it's both a private residence and a restaurant.

We had our choice of sitting inside or outside. The night was cool, the back was covered, so we ate outside. The back looked out over a beautiful garden. The setting was not ornate, it was stately. It's one of the things I love about visitting former communist areas - it's all very simple, clean, and quiet.

Anyway, the meal was out of this world. The service was so good, you feel as if the waiter would invite you to stay with him at Christmas. And halfway through dinner, I was overcome with a sudden sadness that there might be a point in time where I wouldn't remember this.

I believe in reincarnation. And I suppose that along with that, we somehow get our mind erased when we start the next life. Perhaps it makes it easier to enjoy the next life for its own sake to not carry around a bag of memories that no long matter. It all of sudden seemed so unfair that I couldn't have this memory with me always. Who's design was this? Why can't I at least keep my memories? Even if I could hold on to the impression of the memory, it's the sort of thing that I could take with me forever.

I got a little choked up at dinner. David didn't notice. The waiter showed up with our next course. I moved on. The whole night was really wonderful. And I wasn't even hung over this morning. This morning, I'm no closer to wrapping up my thoughts from last night. I guess it's not the sort of thing that gets answered. At least not in this lifetime.
