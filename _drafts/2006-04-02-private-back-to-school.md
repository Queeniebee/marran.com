I had a dream last night that I had to go back to Knox because I never technically finished my last year. God I hate those dreams. I've had them frequently the past year or so. Last night, I remember attending some sort of farewell dinner with everyone in New York. I usually spend the dream thinking if I'm going to audition for a theater production again or if I'm  going to do my own thing.

I think in some ways, the dream reflects how uncomfortable I was to go back to Knox a year after everyone else had graduated. It also brings up issues of feeling like things are out of my control - that there is some mistake in my past that I have yet to resolve. I spend most of the dream thinking about how I'm going to survive without David, Oz, and Gogo and all my friends.
