Servings: Serves 6-8

5 medium Russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and, cut in 1-inch cubes
3 medium parsnips, peeled and cut in 1-inch cubes
1 cup milk
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
½ teaspoon nutmeg
1½ teaspoons salt
freshly ground pepper to taste

In a large pot place the parsnips and potatoes and enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, until vegetables are just tender, about 15 minutes. Place in a colander and drain well.

Mash the vegetables with a potato masher, ricer, or food mill.

Reheat and gradually whisk in the milk and butter (and if using, the minced garlic). Season with nutmeg, salt and pepper.
