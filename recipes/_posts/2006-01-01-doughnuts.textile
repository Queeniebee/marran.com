Although I've come close, I've never had a better doughnut than Grandma Fern's homemade doughnuts.
<!--break-->

In a very large bowl, place the following and let it dissolve:

12 oz evaporated milk (preferably PET)
12 oz warm water
2 packages dry yeast

Once the yeast has dissolved, add the following:

2 teaspoons salt
1 cup sugar
3 eggs lightly beaten
1 cup oil
8 cups flour

Mix everything well. Cover it with a damp cloth and let rise for 3.5 to 4 hours.

Put ⅓ of the dough on a bread board. Roll quite thin. Using a doughnut cutter, cut out the doughnuts and place them on an olied cookie sheet. Let rise 25-30 minutes.

Heat 3 inches of oil in a skillet. Drop the doughnuts in a few at a time. Don't crowd the doughnuts. Turn them only once using the handle of a wooden spoon. Let the doughnuts dry by hanging vertically from a wooden spoon.

For the glaze, mix the following in a mixer until smooth:

1 package (500 grams) powdered sugar
½ cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla

Dip the top side of each doughnut in the glaze. Return the dougnut to the wooden spoon to drip and dry.
