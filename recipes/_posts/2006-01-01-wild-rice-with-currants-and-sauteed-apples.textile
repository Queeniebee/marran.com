Servings: Serves 8

1½ cups wild rice
1½ cups chicken stock
2 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
1½ tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or¾ tsp. dried
1 Granny Smith apple
⅓ cup dried currants or raisins
¼ cup apple brandy (Calvados)

Rinse the rice in several changes of cold water and drain. Combine the rice, stock, water and salt . Bring to a boil and cover and reduce the heat to a gentle boil and cook until the rice is tender (35-45 min). If necessary, drain the rice.

Plump the currants in ⅓ cup Apple brandy for about 20 minutes.

In a medium fry pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the onion and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent (about 5 min). Remove.

Peel core and slice the apple. Cut the slices in half or thirds. Melt the remaining ½ teaspoons butter in the frying pan. Saute the apple stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly browned (about 10 min.)

Stir the onion, apple currants and brandy into the cooked rice. Re-heat if necessary.
