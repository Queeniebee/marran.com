Servings: Serves 10

2 cups fresh cranberries, washed and picked over
2 oranges
1½ cups sugar
2 sticks cinnamon
¼ teaspoon all spice
½ cup port wine
½ cup red currant jelly

Cut the rind of 1 orange into a fine jullian or fine match-sticks. Simmer in water 2-3 minutes. Drain.

In a sauce pan, combine the juice of both oranges, jelly, wine, sugar, cinnamon sticks and all spice. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the cinnamon sticks and add the cranberries and orange-rind.

Bring to a full rolling boil until berries pop, 10 - 12 minutes, then cool.
