Servings: Serves 8

16 ounces Herb Seasoned Stuffing
2½ cups chicken broth (more if necessary)
½ cup olive oil
1 whole onion minced
2 large leeks, white part only
1 cup mushrooms, chopped
1½ cups sweet or hot sausage, crumbled and cooked
2 cups chestnuts, roasted and peeled and diced
¾ cup dried cranberries
1 can water chestnuts drained and diced
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

Saute crumbled sausage in olive oil until cooked, 10 - 15 minutes. Add onion, leek, mushrooms and chestnuts and saute until the onions become translucent. Add the cranberries and water chestnuts to combine.

Add the stuffing and broth to the saute pan and mix until all ingredients are incorporated. Use a large mixing bowl if it doesn't fit all. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Put into large covered casserole, (or cover casserole with foil). At this point you can refrigerate for 2 days. Bring to room temperature. Bake at 325° for about 30 minutes or until hot throughout.
