    message: And what about those of us where The Container Store does not exist?  Given where I live, how about a Sportsman's Warehouse?!

    message: Sportman's Warehouse? Dragging your wife there sounds more like spousal abuse to me. Spouses and Stores-With-Guns don't mix.

I'd like to propose new marriage laws: two people can get married if and only if they log 40 hours together in a Home Depot and/or a Bed, Bath, & Beyond.
