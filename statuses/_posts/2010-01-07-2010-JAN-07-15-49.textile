    message: I have it in a Google Calendar hooked into Jott so I only need to call an 800 number to record it. I win the nerdy award.

    message: How soul crushing. When I read food journaling I was expecting a great NY restaurant and grocery tour. I'm sure you've got that in you too.

    message: "I don't mind a little soul crushing as long as a healthy amount of fat gets crushed in the process. I was down several pounds before the holidays and getting compliments - and it was quite spiritually liberating. "

    message: Right, that. A little less material in the material world can be very spiritually satisfying.

I had gotten away from food journaling over the holidays. Tomorrow, I start recording everything I eat again.
