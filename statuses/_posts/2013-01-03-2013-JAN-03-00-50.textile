    message: I'm reading the unabridged version. I wondered about the movie reference too. The character went to see one of the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, which made no sense to me for timing. So I will have lots to read on the flight home from China. I expect I will get into it as we fly over the arctic circle.

    message: I remember a bit of a lag when initially getting character backstories, but I still ended up liking each one. It has been a while, but that book still tops my list of best multi-character epic. Agree that the ending itself is weak, but the movement and coalescing of each story is staggering. I'll suffer the more than occasional clunker of a line for  story arc this massive with no complaints.

    message: I didn't think the ending was that weak. It's better than what they did in the mini-series.
