      Becoming so accustomed to fancy meals that you forgot to dress nice is almost as tragic as being inconvenienced by renovations to your five-story brownstone in Chelsea.

For the first time, I under dressed for a dinner event. I had to wear a jacket provided by the restaurant. It was so embarrassing.
