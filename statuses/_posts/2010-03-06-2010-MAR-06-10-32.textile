    message: The recipe is essentially a giant vat of tea and pomegranate molasses (http://www.amazon.com/Pomegranate-Molasses-14-oz/dp/B001TZMCD8 - but you should be able to find it locally). David found it too tart, so I will probably blend some honey in with the pomegranate molasses. When I finalize a recipe, I'll post it.

    message: You could make the decaffeinated tea, but the batch I made is caffeinated. I used ceylon tea. My next  batch will probably be darjeeling.

I think I can replace my summer iced coffee addiction with homemade pomegranate iced tea. Just made a batch and it's delicious.
