    message: Oh, I SO love Mad Men!  I have a mad crush on Don Draper (of course).  I love the direction they're taking Peggy.  Mrs. Joan is dressing so much dowdier than Miss Joan.  I miss her swagger.  :(

The writing in Mad Men is so sharp this season. It's like haiku. And Peggy (as always) is my hero.
