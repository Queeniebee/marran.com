    message: Have you ever thought of doing cooking classes.  Your status updates make me envious of what you can do in the kitchen.

    message: Yum, cherries ... I'm in MA, so our CSA just entered "no fruit zone" for the next week or two.  Strawberries are over, blueberries haven't started.  We may get some honey or jam in the meanwhile.

    message: You're making me regret not joining the local CSA this year. I never just go and buy the thing that showed up in our weekly basket.

    message: This is our first year of doing it, but I imagine I'll keep doing it every year. It forces me to not be lazy and order in food because I know I have to finish out the week of CSA items. And I'm far more adventurous about my cooking since it started.

    message: Same here, it's helping my cooking a lot.  But it's intimidating - the number of veggies that a single person is expected to eat makes me feel like a degenerate.   I'm going to have to figure out how to use carrots at breakfast as well as at lunch and dinner.  What's your fav veggie cookbook?

Our CSA fruit share started this week. I smell a cherry, lavender, and red wine tart in the making.
