    message: Gorgeous! But I cannot believe the rural areas would be less photogenic! Less extravagant and glittering perhaps. :-)

      It's somewhat warm during the day (a light jacket usually) and cold at night. It's comparable to winter in the Pacific Northwest, though it depends on what elevation you're at. 
      
      The best part of December is that the skies are almost always clear (for views of the Himalayas) and there are almost no tourists. We hear that Tiger's Nest is mobbed in the summer and we had it to ourselves. I was the first person to enter the temple that day. Many times we had to ask a monk or nun to unlock a temple for us to visit - which added to the serene and austere quality of the temple.
      
      Most of our hotels/lodges didn't have electric heat. They had small wood-burning stoves and would deliver a stack of wood to your room. It was fine at night, the beds are plenty warm, but mornings were cold because you had to start the fire again and wait for the room to warm up.
