      Matt Stone had a trainer. Trey Parker was on his own. So it's not like they were on the same routine or wearing matching spandex outfits or anything like that.
      
      Still...I know what you mean. Don't they do enough together?
      
      FYI: Matt Stone is really attractive. I'm usually good about not being star-struck, but I have to admit that a little bit of my inner giggly schoolgirl came out when he sat at the table next to me.

I was trying to figure out if this guy at my gym was Matt Stone, turned the corner, and there was Trey Parker.
