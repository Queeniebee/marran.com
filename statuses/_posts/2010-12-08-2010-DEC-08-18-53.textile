    message: I haven't seen Freaks and Geeks. I'll check it out. Yes, I had written him off after seeing his bad Spider-Man performances, but now I'm having to re-evaluate.

    message: Will you watch the new movie/doco he's starring in called 127 Hours? It's about the guy who was mountain climbing in Utah who performed DIY amputation to free his arm when it became trapped by a falling rock.....

link-info: "As a part of the New York Times' collection \"Fourteen Actors Acting,\" James Franco takes to a mirror and gets down with his bad self. We can honestly say it's done in the classiest way possible, though! Ladies: You're welcome."
