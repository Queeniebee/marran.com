    message: I did that too - and I read they are rewriting parts of it, now out of respect for him.

    message: "As much as I love the show, I think they need to change some things (The song \"It Sucks To Be Me\" ends with everyone agreeing that Gary Coleman has it the worst). I can't imagine being the actress that had to play Gary Coleman on the day he died. I assume they made an announcement to the audience before the show. "

    message: "I think I am ok for changes if the writer think that the show is dated or it can be even better/funnier with re-write.  However, I think Gary Coleman is part of the history of the show.  It is kind of suck to to be him so in any case that line should be even stronger.  I guess I'm a little insensitive but certainly not with disrespect.    "
