    message: I totally agree with Thomas. But I'm not old enough to be friends with people with bone spurs either. Next thing you know, I will only wear flats.

I had a gout scare this weekend. Lots of pain in big toe for no reason. Turns out it's a bone spur. I was not ready to be Someone With Gout.
