      Rosie - My big toe was in searing pain shortly after 2010 started. It's almost healed now.
      
      Tom - I wish I could go into a coma for the next six months, wake up and immediately watch the final season of Lost. I've never loved a show this much. Reading that interview has me definitely excited - especially knowing now that it's all Bollywood-esque musical numbers.

    message: LOL.  I'd just love to see Jack and Sawyer break into song and dance and end up in a hot, romantic embrace :-p
