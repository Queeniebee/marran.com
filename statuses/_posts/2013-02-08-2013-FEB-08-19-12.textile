    message: I have to pipe up, because the Dark & Stormy is the official drink of
      me. It's probably a little late to be giving suggestions for the current round
      of drinks, but I highly recommend Cock & Bull ginger beer and Cruzan blackstrap
      rum. The rum is especially amazing.

    message: Ooo! I hadn't tried that! I'm having Gosling's ginger beer and Sailor
      Jerry spiced rum. But I definitely want to try blackstrap rum now.

It's Dark & Stormy. Therefore, I'm now drinking a Dark & Stormy. As it is within, so shall it be outside.
