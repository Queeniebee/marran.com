    message: "Locke and Helen talking about facing reality. Specifically, when Helen said that miracles do exist and that she supported him. It really got to me. "

    message: I even got a little choked up when Locke was fed up in the parking lot and had just been fired and Hugo showed up. I don't know...this whole season has me on raw emotions for some reason.

    message: I feel the same way, Keith.  This season has a lot to live up to, and so far, so good IMO.

Is it just me or are other Losties consistently choked up by each episode this season? It's significantly better than I expected.
