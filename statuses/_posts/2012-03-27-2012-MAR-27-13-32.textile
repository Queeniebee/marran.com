    message: I'm not sure what you mean by 'constant parental involvement'  this mom is clearly off her rocker.  I am deeply engrained in my children's lives, however there are boundaries of privacy for experiences they encounter that are THEIR stories to share, not mine.  This woman goes beyond 'parental involvement', she's taken it to sociopathic levels.

    message: That wouldn't have stopped her, and you know it. The kid will probably turn out fine. Her mother is already beyond hope, and who would want to help her even if they could? Sounds like the mom needs to shut up and get laid, if she can find a blind moron to step up to the plate and service the unit.
