      In the first few seasons, they did flash backs interspersed with the present time. Then they did a season (or two) of flash-presents where we were following the island and the Oceanic 6. And I believe that they are now doing flash-forwards. I think this "alternate reality" is actually the future reality. I don't know the specifics of the battle with the MIB/Flocke, but I predict that it will end by resetting the timeline, the island will be at the bottom of the ocean trapping MIB/Flocke, and everyone will arrive safely in LAX - ready to play out the "alternate reality" that we are currently seeing. So the "alternate reality" that we are watching is actually the final chapter.
      
      When Juliet set off the bomb, we were all lead to believe that it didn't work because nothing happened. Juliet said that it did work, though. I think the actual bomb going off didn't reset anything or branch off another reality. I think it set in motion certain events for characters that shape the decisions they will make in their battle with MIB/Flocke. And those actions will eventually reset the timeline allowing them to land safely in LAX.
      
      My two cents.

Last night's episode of Lost was amazing - the episode I had been waiting years for. I think I kind of know how this all ends.
