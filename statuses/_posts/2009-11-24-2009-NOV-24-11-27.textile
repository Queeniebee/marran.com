    message: Use a super-secret portable hard drive to hide them all...bury it deep in your closet.  Low cost, doesn't take up much space, and takes away the trauma and anxiety of "what if I deleted the wrong one".....

    message: I horrify some of my friends and delete stuff that's unusable in camera.  I highly recommend deleting on a regular basis!

      I used to delete photos in camera, but I had a teacher that convinced me otherwise. He often highlighted photos I almost deleted. I have since decided to see the a photo on a computer screen before I decide.
      
      And really, I'm only deleting photos that are ridiculously over/under exposed or out of focus. There's no reason I should hold on to them.

I am caught up in a frenzy of deleting photos that I had deemed unusable, but didn't have the nerve to delete before.
