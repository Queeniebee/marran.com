    message: Yesterday my otherwise classic rock/rock station played the "wig down from the shelf" song from Hedwig.  That sufficed very nicely.

    message: The boys next door have Cher streaming today.  Hey, hey!  I sent Liliana to the parade all decked out in rainbows.  Is 5 years old too early to learn that there are two meanings of the words "fairies"  and "queens".

      I just drove across SF and while I made an effort to skirt Pride I was surprised at how little overt gayness I encountered. I thought I was dangerously close to Civic Center. 
      
      In any case, I'll go find some Kylie Minogue now.

in honor of Pride Day, I suggest you play the gayest song you can find and spend some time dancing around like a ninny. My recommendation is "Your Disco Needs You" by Kylie Minogue, but I'm open to suggestions.
