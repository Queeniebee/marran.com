      I agree!  Some 80s stuff gets dated and cheesy with age and some drifts to avant garde minimalism.  "Sweet Dreams" is the latter (though I only know that song and "Love is a Stranger").
      
      They never carried through on their early promise for me.  Like, I always though "Savage" should have been a great album, but it was, in fact, kind of a bad album.  My second favorite is probably the soundtrack to "1984" in that same kind of "its own thing" way.
