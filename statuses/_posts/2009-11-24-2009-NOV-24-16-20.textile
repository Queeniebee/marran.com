    message: Canaan Dogs are very perceptive.  When we placed Lucy (who had NO enemies) with a family with 3 young children she decided she hated their neighbor. The mother called me all worried about it and I said, "I trust her. If Lucy of all dogs doesn't like someone, there is a very good reason."  She admitted later that the guy was kind of weird.

Gogo only hates one person: our gardner. Fiercely hates him. Someday we will find out that he's a vampire or undead in some other way.
