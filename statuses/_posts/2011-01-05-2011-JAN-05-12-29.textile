DC is reprinting Flex Mentallo later this year! If I had to pick four comics that were thrilling, mind-warping, consciousness-expanding, and goose-bump inducing...it would be Flex Mentallo. And how it maintains an innocent homo-eroticism is beyond me. I smile and giggle a little every time I see the words "Flex Mentallo".
