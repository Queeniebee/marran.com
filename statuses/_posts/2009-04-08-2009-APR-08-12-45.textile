      How do you make raw cashew cream? Or is this an item that you purchase already prepared?
      
      The tart sounds lovely.

    message: I bought cashew butter at the health food store and added agave, maple syrup, and brazil nut milk to it until it got a creamy consistency.

    message: Hmm. I might try that. I'm thinking I might sub in coconut milk for the maple syrup and brazil nut milk.
