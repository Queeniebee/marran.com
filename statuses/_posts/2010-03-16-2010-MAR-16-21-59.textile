      We fly in May 17th and leave May 22nd, but we are only using Vienna as a port. We will be spending our time in Bratislava. 
      
      Have you been to Vienna? It is in my top 5 favorite European cities. I would put a visit to Demel and a viewing of Bosch's "The Last Judgement" as the two must-dos for Vienna.

      This will be my first time visiting Europe. We're flying to Prague on May 12 and then taking the train to Vienna on the 17th. "

      Wow, Celeste. What a great trip. I have advice on Prague, too. 
      
      Beware of pickpocketers. People say that about everywhere, but it's really true there. The only place in the world we've ever been pickpocketed is in Prague.
      
      Of course, do all the big stuff - the castle, the clock, the Jewish Cemetery, the Golem, etc. I really enjoyed the Loreta (near the castle) which has a statue of a crucified female saint with a beard. There's a full story inside the chapel about it.
      
      But the MUST DO in Prague is get to a small town outside the city called Kutna Hora (you can rent a car or take the train). On the outskirts of that town is The Sedlec Ossuary. We had to ask directions from the locals to find it. It is one of the most bizarre places I have ever seen in my life. I don't want to tell you too much about it because if I tell you that it's decorated with human bones you wouldn't understand what it's really like. It has to be seen to be believed.
