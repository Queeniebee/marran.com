    message: Cleaning my desk is one of those tasks that I never really complete. Somehow there's always a pile still to deal with when I run out of time, and things start stacking again. Maddening.

    message: I did same thing - took me 2 days to clear out and organize about 2.5 years worth of clutter, filing, and move/remove.  It was liberating, thrilling and a bit scary.  Loved it.

I have already surpassed all my accomplishments of last year with today's task: I have cleaned my office. There is not one piece of paper on my desk. I had forgotten just how humungous my desk is. All this organization has left me stultified.
