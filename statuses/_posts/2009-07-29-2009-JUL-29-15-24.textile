    message: Congrats!  Glad it is all coming together nicely for you guys.  Renovations are extremely stressful - and seem to go on forever.  But wow - what a reward at the end of it all, huh?

    message: Well...this renovation has really bugged me. But yes, the room will be beautiful. I think I was the one person in NYC that was enjoying the storm. I took a nap on the new bed underneath the new skylight, listening to the rain hit the glass. Ahhh...

The furniture for the guest bedroom has arrived and is in place. Woo-hoo! It's nicer than I envisioned.
