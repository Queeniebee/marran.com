    message: It was wonderful. It's definitely paced for kids (slow and easy), but the story is good and the visuals are amazing.

    message: Thank you! I was thinking it might be a good one to take the 9 year old to see.

    message: Your nephew is in the 6-10 age, Keith? I ask because I'm thinking of taking Romulus and Remus (age 6) to Hugo before I take them to Muppets. Is that a Bowery thumbs up, then?

    message: My nephew is a couple of months shy of 6, so it's definitely okay for the 6 - 10 range. I was worried that it was going to be too long, but he followed it all the way to the end and only got a little fidgety in a couple of spots.

I took my nephew to see "Hugo" yesterday and "The Lion King" today. The lesson is: everyone that loves you will die someday soon.
