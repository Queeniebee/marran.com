    message: Me?  Did I introduce you to Sparks? Is "Kimono My House" a great album or what?

      Yes, you gave it to me - snuck in with Thom Yorke of all things. I guess the two balance each other out.
      
      Yes, the whole album is great.

    message: I love Thom Yorke. I was just saying that in terms of style, they are at opposite ends of the spectrum, so it's a good balance. After I get all moody and contemplative listening to Yorke, I can listen to The Sparks and start bouncing around the room.

    message: "That I can relate to.  One thing that has always been fun about sharing music with you is that you share that rare trait of liking music regardless of genre.  S'nice.  BTW: Os Mutantes appears to have reformed with a new album.  Must investigate."

    message: Well...I'm skeptical of a new Os Mutantes album, but it's always worth a try. My friend, Jeff, got some Rita Lee covers of Beatles songs. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is particularly well done.
