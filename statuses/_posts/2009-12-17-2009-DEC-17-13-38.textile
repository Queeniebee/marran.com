message: The new movie "Daybreakers" doesn't come out until Jan 8th. "New Moon" will be out of the theaters before that. Which means, there will be a few days where we will be COMPLETELY WITHOUT VAMPIRE MOVIES! Stock up on DVDs now people! This could get ugly.

The new movie "Daybreakers" doesn't come out until Jan 8th. "New Moon" will be out of the theaters before that. Which means, there will be a few days where we will be COMPLETELY WITHOUT VAMPIRE MOVIES! Stock up on DVDs now people! This could get ugly.
