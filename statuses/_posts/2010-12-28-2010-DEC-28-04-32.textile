message: We've had two nights in a hotel now due to the weather in New York. We're standing by for flights today, but I'm not hopeful (we have a seat for a flight on Wednesday morning if today doesn't work out). If we make it back today, I'm expecting NYC to be in a post-apocalyptic state - like something out of "12 Monkeys." Seriously, this has been ridiculous.

    message: I thought of you when I heard about the snow chaos in NYC, well, and the rest of the eastern seaboard...  This is obviously not a good time for travel!  Hope you do manage to get a flight today.

    message: There are armored garbage trucks with giant shields attached to the front bumper running up and down Broadway. They must be carrying food and water to the ad hoc government currently barricaded in the mosque at ground zero.
