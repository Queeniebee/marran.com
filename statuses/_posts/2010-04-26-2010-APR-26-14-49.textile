    message: Which is funny, because that is my LEAST favorites of their albums.  What else are you grooving on?

      I've been too ashamed to admit it to anyone, but I've really been liking Kasabian lately. Please don't think I'm shallow. Well..actually, please do.
      
      And I've been listening to the Beatles in mono a lot lately. I know. Shocker. 
      
      What about you?

      I kind of meant "any other Flaming Lips," but I am always interested in your tunes.
      
      I am on a Bealtes resurgence.  "Let it Be .. Naked" hasn't left my cd player for months.  But that might partially be because I rarely listen to cds.
      
      I don't even know who Kasabian is.  Don't think I'm shallow.

I just went gaga for "At War With the Mystics". It's like someone flipped a switch and now I'm a fanatic. Oh...those Flaming Lips.
