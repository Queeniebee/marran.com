    message: FYI, I can't stop watching this.  I think my new favorite part comes around 1:38 when he starts to tell his "most favorite quote of all times in the history of the spoken word" and misquotes it.  He does this cute little horrified bark thing right after, "in the middle of opportunity" (bark!)... "excuse me, in the middle of DIFFICULTY..." Take a minute to watch that part again.  It's so worth it.
