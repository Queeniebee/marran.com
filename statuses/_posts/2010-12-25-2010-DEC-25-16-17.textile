    message: "#1 is definite the La Surprise I ordered at Pierre Hermes in Paris. #2 is the Esterhaszy Torte I had in Vienna. #3 is the fried apple pie at McDonalds. Just kidding. I know I've had some great desserts but those first two and the fried zucchini blossoms were both excellent and have burned themselves into my memory. "
