message: David and I have started a new habit that fully establishes the fact that we have been together a long time. When he gets invited to conferences in ...say... Argentina in March ... instead of asking me if I want to go, he sends me a meeting request. I click on the "Yes, I plan to attend" button. It's all very romantic.

David and I have started a new habit that fully establishes the fact that we have been together a long time. When he gets invited to conferences in ...say... Argentina in March ... instead of asking me if I want to go, he sends me a meeting request. I click on the "Yes, I plan to attend" button. It's all very romantic.
