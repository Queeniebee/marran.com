    message: I'm not pumicing someone else's feet. But if you'd like, I can call you at 5:30am to wake you and remind you to take a long bath followed by yoga and meditation!

      I tried meditating in the morning before coffee once; re-woke up at noon.

    message: Considering you wake up at 11:30am, I don't think that's such a big deal.
