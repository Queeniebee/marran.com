      Dawn, Flunk Day is...hard to describe. Try this: http://www.thewikifire.org/index.php?title=Flunk_Day and this: http://www.thewikifire.org/index.php?title=Flunk_Day_activities
      
      It's a mysterious day that occurs in the spring semester at Knox. The bells ring at about 5am signaling no classes. There are movies, activities, bands, and general Bacchic mayhem.
      
      REM played on Flunk Day one year. In "Its the End of the World as We Know It", one verse starts with "The other night I tripped at Knox" and this is in reference to their Flunk Day appearance.
      
      Ah...Flunk Day. I have many fond memories.
