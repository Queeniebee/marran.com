    message: Keith, they're gorgeous. We have a flowering quince upstate (not the quince tree with fruit, more of a giant bush)... the flowers are a deeper pink. I'll bring you some in April.

link-info: For David's 50th, our good friends Maria & Michael sent us some quince branches. I had never heard of keeping quince branches as a cut flower, but they have turned out to be beautiful.
