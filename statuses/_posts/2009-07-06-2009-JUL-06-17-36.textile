    message: Yum.  If I may offer a flavor idea, add a 1/4 cup of Irish Cream to your next batch of vanilla.....and maybe a handful of white chocolate chips...I made it once last summer and it was gone way too quickly.

I've really been into making homemade ice cream this summer. Today's flavor: peach. I could have finished eating the whole batch myself.
