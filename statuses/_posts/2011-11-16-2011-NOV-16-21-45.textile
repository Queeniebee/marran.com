    message: "Sure! It's here: http://stephanieknits.blogspot.com/2007/03/keeping-boyfriends-ears-warm-since-2006.html. The first time I made this, I followed the pattern and it came out loose and too short. The second time I made it I went down a size on the needles and made it 7.5 inches before starting the decreases. The size and shape is much better that way. And the next time I do it, I'm going to do a 1x1 rib for the first 8 rows to make sure it stays tight at the bottom."

    message: Perfect!    I can convert this to a crochet pattern & knock out a hat over a gloomy weekend.  Thanks!  You look so good in yours I think Rob needs one!

    message: "Thanks! It took me 3 days, but you're probably faster than I am. Also, I used this wool which I highly recommend: http://www.thefibreco.com/roadtochina.html. Super soft and not itchy at all."

    message: Nice!  Crochet is quicker than knitting... It will take me a little time to translate the knit stitches to crochet, after that it's a cinch!

link-info: I just finished my latest knitting project. This was a hat I made for a friend. It's based on The Boyfriend Hat. I've found it to be a good, all-purpose winter hat project with some modifications. This is made from a super-soft merino wool.
