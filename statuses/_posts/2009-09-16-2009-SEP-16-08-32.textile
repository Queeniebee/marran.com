      I was on a school trip and we went to visit an ashram. A guru had singled me out and told me that I needed to learn to beg. I tried. He said "Not good enough." Then I prostrated myself in blind devotion. He said "Yes. That's it." Later he gave us a lecture that we have to learn to do this for God. 
      
      Since that dream, if I am feeling agitated or exhausted or unable to stop my mind from creating anxiety, I remember the dream and it all stops, leaving me in a state of peace.
      
      This morning I opened a book and stumbled across a description of the Tibetan rituals of prostration and devotion. It was kinda weird.

    message: Nope. That one was all me. It might have been the fallout of a conversation about obsession, though. Still, I love it when someone teaches me new skills in dreams.

I had a dream over the weekend that I am now realizing is perhaps the most profound dream I've ever had.
