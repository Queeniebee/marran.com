    message: Wonderful. Just looked up a recipe. Did you use macaroons and some weird spicy pear ingredient?  That was what was in the recipe I found.

    message: The insides are pumpkin, parmigiano reggiano, amaretti, and mostarda di fruitta (a special Italian concoction with candied fruit soaked in mustard). It's a bizarre list of ingredients that combines to one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. I originally had it in Mantova in Italy and wrote down the name of the name of the dish so I would never forget it.

    message: "Just butter and a sprinkle of parmiggiano reggiano. This is the recipe to follow: http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Tortelli-di-zucca.html. Google will translate the page for you. The hard part is finding the mostarda di fruitta (it's important and there's no substitute for it), but I have an Italian grocery store a block away."

Bravo to the Italians for inventing Tortelli di Zucca. An thanks to Robb for teaching me how to make it.
