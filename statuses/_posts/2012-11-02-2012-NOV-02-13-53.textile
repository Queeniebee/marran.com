      That's a very non-workplace sort-of-smell. Not pleasant and very distracting...
      Almost worse when you pin-point the culprit AND realise it happens almost daily. (Speaking from experience.)

    message: I've narrowed it down to the blonde grungy guy with a British accent next to me or the very thin blonde woman across from me that looks like she just stepped out of a Anthropologie. It's probably the Brit. He looks like he just stumbled out of a pub. But I so want it to be the girl.

Someone in my shared office space is hugely drunk. There's a very strong smell of alcohol breath. But I can't place who it is because everyone is quietly typing on their laptops.
