      So far, I've just been playing with all of it. I primarily got it for long flights and watching the final episodes of Lost. But it's clear that it's going to be very powerful as more and more apps become available. The NYTimes looks great on it. Email is as good as working on a desktop. 
      
      And yes I have an iPhone, and I was one of the lucky few that got Netshare, so I can tether my iPad to my phone for a 3G connection when I might need it.

First impressions of my iPad: it's not as hard to type as I thought. And it is worth the hype.
