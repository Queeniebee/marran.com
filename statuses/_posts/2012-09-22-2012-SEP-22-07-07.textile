    message: It just adds those addresses, doesn't overwrite. I think iOS has a new ability to link contacts together that originate from different services (FB, twitter, Skype, g+. I've been waiting for that.

    message: Yes. The Facebook linking worked very well. It didn't recognize that two contacts were the same person. I linked my contact to Facebook and it automatically de-duplicated them. I must admit, the more I use iOS 6, The more I love it.

    message: I decided to pass on this iPhone (for now). I just got my 4S in December, so I don't feel compelled to upgrade.

Has anyone used the new feature in iOS 6 that allows Facebook to update your contact info? I don't want it wiping out email addresses with Facebook's pseudo email addresses.
