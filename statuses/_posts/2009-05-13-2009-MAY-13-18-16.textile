    message: Ikea has a hydraulic adjustable standing desk. I think it's important to have one that moves. Not that I do. I am completely ergonomically incorrect.

    message: We have ergonomically correct adjustable desks at work and I love it!  Electrical/mechanical - I usually stand in the mornings and sit after lunch.  It's great and I highly recommend it!
