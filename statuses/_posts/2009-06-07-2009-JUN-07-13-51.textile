    message: My brother-in-law, who's from Milan, was just complaining to about not being to use a man-purse in the US. He misses his.

    message: As a US male, we are only allowed beat-up messenger bags (not too small to be dainty and not too big to be purse-like) or cargo pants with all the pockets filled. It's sad that we are only allowed to be practical in small confined.

    message: Welcome back... and thank god you're still man-purse-less. You must be well aware that Milan's design community has been trying to get the rest of the western world to embrace that ill-conceived idea for years. It's a massive conspiracy, like the Illuminati or Opus Dei or something... it's sure to be featured in the next Dan Brown novel. RESIST!

Man purses are all the rage in Milan. I still wouldn't be caught dead with one.
