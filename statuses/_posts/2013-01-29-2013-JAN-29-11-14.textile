    message: ! 'I thought it was great! (I general like Judd Apatow stuff like Knocked
      Up because it''s painfully honest and doesn''t go for big laughs.) Very smart
      writing. And I think it''s about something real - the old avenues for success
      and happiness don''t really exist anymore. We are told that we''re supposed
      to create new paths but no one knows what that looks like anymore.


      I didn''t really understand the complaint that it''s solely about a bunch of
      over-privileged, lazy twenty-somethings. It''s partly about that, but that''s
      kind of the point of the show. It''s very aware of who these people are and
      it presents their short-comings objectively.


      The other thing I heard was that it was Sex & the City with twenty-somethings.
      I suppose you could make that argument, but Girls didn''t remind me of S&tC
      at all. It felt like it was about real, non-stereotypical people with complicated
      feelings. Carrie Bradshaw and her friends were all about celebrating all new
      sexual freedoms, but Hannah and her friends are sometimes more comfortable with
      the old limitations. Freedom does not equal happiness.


      I don''t think I would have liked the show AT ALL if Adam Driver wasn''t in
      it - both the actor and the character. If his character weren''t in the show,
      then it would feel like a S&tC with spoiled twenty-somethings. He was the layer
      of complexity that brought it all together for me.'

    message: Cerelle, you're absolutely right. It's Lena Dunham's. I didn't mean to
      say that it's his work. I meant to say that I like that style of very honest
      comedy for which he is known for - and I would include Girls in that style.
