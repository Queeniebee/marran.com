      But isn't the "playfulness" part of what offends about BSF?  For me what is shocking about that one is not necessarily the worldview or the actual scenes, but rather picturing it getting made.  Who were those people? Sardus never appeared in another movie; Ralphus only in one "mainstream" pornographic film.  Utterly bizarre as a time-capsule piece.
      
      Salo, was morally, philosophically and aesthetically degenerate.  I agree that it hollows you out as art.
      
      You know what is on my list?  "Very Bad Things."  It wasn't even a very good movie, but for some reason it left me feeling empty for days.  Can't quite explain why.

      "Lolita" is really disturbing. The combination of eroticizing a 12-year-old and putting you on the pedophile's side is excruciatingly uncomfortable (and yes.. funny, and brilliant, and...)
      I haven't read it in years, but I think "Geek Love" was pretty shocking as well...

    message: When I was 15, I read American Psycho. Even though it was censored here, a friend somehow managed to get her hands on a copy. It scared the bee-jesus out of me. I think the sight of men in suits and ties freaked me out for a long time afterwards. And as for movies, SAW terrified me beyond belief....

      Leslie - It sounds like I need to catch up on my Lars von Triers movies. I'm downloading "Dogville." Also, I ran across "The Idiots" and it looks really good.
      
      I love "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover." The scenes of the grotesque feasts that the thieves would have were the first time I considered going vegetarian. And I love the scene where the Thief realizes his wife has left him for another man and shouts "I'M GOING TO KILL HIM. AND THEN I'M GOING TO EAT HIM!"
      
      Joel - I don't understand what's disturbing about the idea of BSF being made. Honestly, I think everyone had a great time. Everyone is so over-the-top, how could they not? FYI - The actor playing Sardu never made another movie because he was stabbed to death by a burglar the year after BSF came out.

      Dogville is really good, but be sure to watch it with your full attention.  It's awesomeness could kind of slide by if you just idly watch it.
      
      As for BSF, I dunno, calling it an over the top giggle fest seems a bit revisionist.

    message: Leslie, while I loved Bjork and the songs in "Dancer in the Dark," that movie made me hate Lars van Trier.  It was only through relentless coaxing that I saw, Dogville and loved it.  I agree.  I would unwatch "Dancer."  Such a fever pitch of misery that was impossible not be effected by, but, IMHO, truly underserved and emotionally and intellectually dishonest.  HATED that movie.

      I never saw "Dancer in the Dark" because it sounded gratuitously depressing. I will stick with that decision. 
      
      And I will put the knitting needles away when I watch Dogville and give it my full attention. 
      
      Thanks.

Having a conversation with someone about books and/or movies that truly shocked/disturbed/offended me when I experienced them. For books, I'm drawing a blank. For movies, "Salo" definitely shattered me beyond what I thought was possible. And "Blood Sucking Freaks" comes as a close second (though BSF somehow seems too playful to be taken seriously). 

I'm sure I must be forgetting some. Anyone have any suggestions?
