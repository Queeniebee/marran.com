      It's fluctuating between "That wasn't painful at all" to "I'm ready to amputate my foot if the pain doesn't subside".
      
      I have a theory that as we get older, pain is not as intense as it is when we're kids - but our tolerance for it so much less.

      Hrm.  I'm not sure if I agree with that one....
      Regardless, I think this early morning tragedy warrants an early cocktail (or a late mimosa/bloody mary...)

Who says moving heavy objects in bare feet is a dumb idea? My left little toe, that's who.
