    message: I have playlists set up by play count and those playlists get synced to my iPhone so that I always have my most popular music with me. It would be a bummer to lose that data.

    message: more importantly, Queen is awesome.  I went through a Queen binge recently and discovered that their self titled debut, "Jazz" and "Sheer Heart Attack" were all super awesome.
