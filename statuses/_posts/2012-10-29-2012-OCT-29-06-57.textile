    message: Sure enough, as soon as I posted a snide and sarcastic comment about the lack of rain, I started hearing drops on the roof.

    message: Actually, last night and this morning was so calm in my neighborhood that I now think we should have one day a week without public transportation. Everyone in NYC should plan their lives around staying in their own neighborhood on Sunday night. It's good for us.

    message: How are your things your end now? Seen some news here and it's at least looking very wet and windy right now.... That expected giant wave sounds worrying. Hope you're OK!

    message: Giant wave?! I haven't heard of that one! In my neighborhood, it's mildly wet and that's about it. I hear that the water level has risen over the sidewalks on the edge of town.

    message: Downtown there has been flooding. Con Ed just called to say that they may pre-emptively shut down power here (salt water + the grid = bad bad bad)

    message: Well, I haven't any details of this giant wave and no real concept of the expected hit area. Let's hope It's exaggerated...

It's a good thing they closed down all the NYC subways 12 hours ago because we've had at least 5 drops of rain since then.
