    message: You weren't missing out on anything.  High trash is the word!  That's 2 hours of my life I can't get back.

    message: I saw it in the theater before it was rebranded as kitch.  I have never been able to shake the dirty, dirty feeling I got form watching what was pretty clearly the worst movie ever made.  It is too late for me to enjoy, but many say it works as kitsch.

    message: Yeah, it is so bad that it is mesmerizing. You may not be able to watch it in one sitting, but if you walk away for a while, you'll find yourself coming back for more.

I just saw a clip from "Showgirls" and I can never decide if I'm lucky to have not seen it or if I'm missing out on high trash.
