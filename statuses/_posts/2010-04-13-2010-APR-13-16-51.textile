      Spontaneous in that it wasn't planned?
      
      haha
      
      A local radio station plays four hours of Beatles every Saturday morning and I have been tuning in weekly.  It has been a fun way to revisit songs I know too well to put on the stereo.

      One of the things I occasionally miss about New York is being able to drive and listen to the radio. On a recent trip to California, the radio played \"Hey Jude\". And I think I said out loud - \"Of all the Beatles songs to choose and they pick this tired one.\" And about a minute into it, I was belting it out in the car like it was the most meaningful song in the world. \n\n\
      Yeah, The Beatles.\n\n\
      Have you ever seen \"The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?\" I love the movie and I spent a while thinking if there was anything in my life or anything that I could imagine happening that would make me want to have my memory erased. And then I realized that I would have erased the entire Beatles catalog from my mind. Can you imagine being an adult and hearing all this music for the first time? "

    message: I've seen it.  Very freaky film... and what a deliciously creative use of the F-'d up concept.  Riffing off that ... I'd like to use it, perhaps, to erase my own books - for a great regret is that I can't experience them like everyone else.

      I loved it, a rare movie that was both avant garde and emotionally resonant.
      
      While I know what you mean about wiping out the Beatles, I think I would choose not to.  They are such the background of my life since elementary school.  I hear them now and it sends out visions and images of my childhood through now, a constant measure for where I have been and where I am going.  In that way, they have transcended music and are a a background that I project my life onto.
      
      While it would be fun to hear them as music again, a historical and emotional dowsing rod is a better use for them, IMHO.

I'm listening to The Beatles "Tomorrow Never Knows" for the first time in years. I think I just had a spontaneous out of body experience.
