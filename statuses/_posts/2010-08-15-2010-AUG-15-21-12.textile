    message: I have no idea. I thought they marketed it to death, but I don't watch mainstream TV. I think it's a hard concept to sell, but once I explain it to someone, they think it's cool. Also, the comic book looks very "manga" which doesn't go over so well in this country. And I think people may be tired of Michael Cera - though he is not up to his old schtick in this movie.
