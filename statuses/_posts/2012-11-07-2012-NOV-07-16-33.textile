    message: We Minnesotans are feeling very good about our state today. For the last two months my neighborhood sidewalks have been flanked by bright orange and blue signs. Lorenz insisted that we get one and when we did, he proudly stuck it in the front lawn. And he is six. So there is no going back to the dark ages thankfully. Lorenz and I can't wait to celebrate your marriage in two weeks! Much love, Sis

Ten years ago, I never thought that gay marriage would be legal. It seemed as if there was a mountain of homophobia and apathy to gay rights in this country. Every time I hear of these little achievements, I get misty. I'm so grateful for every single person that voted to make this a reality.
