    message: Visit your local Hindu temple all dhoti-fied. One tree in a big frest, Keith. In NYC there's like 6 within MTA distance - well within the 5 boroughs. I know of two in Hudson County as well - should you dare to dhothi on the the way to Poughkeepsie.

      Is it the beige silky one, or the saffronish cotton?
      If it's the beige silk dhoti, you will need a matching silk shirt to go with it. I think you'll look great in it!

    message: "It's a white silk dhoti with orange brocade. If I get invited to A Hindu wedding, I'll get a silk shirt.  Otherwise, I'm going to mix it into my typical summer fair. "

I thought it took a lot of nerve to wear a kilt in NYC. I bought a dhoti. It's beautiful but will definitely require some guts.
