    message: I think it will be a miracle if I can keep it alive in our house for more than a year or two. I have a grand notion of making tea from the leaves. It's supposed to have amazing health benefits.

    message: Tea from the leaves?  I didn't know you could do that.  I have a few olive trees in my back yard.  Would you want me to bring a branch of leaves back for you?

ordered an olive tree for the house. I don't quite know why. It seems like a good idea.
