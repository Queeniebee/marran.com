    message: I loved it and echo those who said it starts slow, but picks up. There
      are so many characters to establish, and they are all important. The only thing
      I didn't like about it, is that he updated it a while after he wrote it and
      changed the year it's set in, but some of the pop-culture references were clearly
      from the earlier version (such as what movie was playing  the plague hit); I
      didn't understand how his editor didn't catch that. But otherwise, it stands
      out in my mind as one of the better novels I've read.

    message: I'm reading the unabridged version. I wondered about the movie reference
      too. The character went to see one of the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, which
      made no sense to me for timing. So I will have lots to read on the flight home
      from China. I expect I will get into it as we fly over the arctic circle.

    message: I remember a bit of a lag when initially getting character backstories,
      but I still ended up liking each one. It has been a while, but that book still
      tops my list of best multi-character epic. Agree that the ending itself is weak,
      but the movement and coalescing of each story is staggering. I'll suffer the
      more than occasional clunker of a line for  story arc this massive with no complaints.

I'm trying to read King's The Stand and it is slow going to say the least. Any words of encouragement to keep me going?
