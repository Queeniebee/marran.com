    message: The loss of unconditional and uncomplicated love?  Loss of a true long-term relationship?  How can you NOT feel sad about that if you're human?

      I was at a pet hospital years ago, and amongst the fluff sentiment posters was one that, essentially, said that the act of caring so deeply for an animal that you know will die before you is a demonstration/wish fulfillment of how we yearn to be remembered after we die.  
      
      I wish I wrote down how it was phrased, and I sometimes wonder if it has gotten better over time.  But the contrast of what truly seemed to me to be a deep sentiment over an hazy picture of a cute kitten and puppy was striking.
