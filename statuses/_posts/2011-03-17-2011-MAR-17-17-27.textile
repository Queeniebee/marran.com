    message: Thank you! There are a couple of rough spots that are hidden, but overall it came out well. The pattern was so dull that I never want to do a scarf again. After this it's hats and gloves - shorter and more interesting projects.

    message: Looks great! So how are those gloves coming along? The ones I was supposed to give you finger-making help on, and I don't think I ever actually did?

      It's a great pattern Keith. The scarf looks so elegant!
      I might've said this before.. but why are you SO multi-talented?

I finally finished David's winter scarf. It's now a 2011-12 winter scarf. I'm starting work on a hat to match. I hope to be done before October.
