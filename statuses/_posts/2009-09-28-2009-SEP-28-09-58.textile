    message: I take that back...I've been to sections of Turkey that are considered Asia, but that never felt like it counted to me. China is the real deal.

    message: Thanks, Brian. I will definitely go there. I'm a little nervous about the food in China, so I appreciate recommendations. People have told me to expect to lose 5 pounds due to stomach illness. I don't know if that's a good thing or not.

    message: OLD BEIJING NOODLE KING IS DELICIOUS. Kind of bewildering, but delicious. Just make an attempt to order and enjoy whatever they bring you.

After looking at our flights in the 2 weeks, I think of our 6 hr flight to LAX as a puddle jumper.
