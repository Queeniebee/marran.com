    message: How about an iPad? You can use a kindle app ad well as download other stuff (like medical journals) as well.

    message: I have an iPad and David is not taken with it. I have given up trying to read books on my iPad. The screen is too bright. The thing I like about the Kindle is that it's e-ink, there's no monthly plan, he can download the NY Times, and it works abroad.
