    message: I was forced to live a week without dairy in China and found that I'm much happier without it. No more stuffed sinuses, skin is softer/smoother, I have more energy, etc. The only time I really miss it is in coffee. But I can live happily with this substitution.

    message: Ah.  Wouldn't it be easier to just suck it up and drink it black??

    message: I tried that last week. Usually just a shot of espresso. But I don't really like the taste of black coffee. The brazil nut milk mellows it out for me. It takes 10 minutes to make a batch of nut milk, so it's not really that much more work.

    message: Is there a difference between nut milk and nut butter? Or is nut milk just nut butter but with more water?

      This one continues to plague me.  I was happier without dairy, but it would require a ton of diet reorg, not just remove dairy.  Like, I tried my staple salad bars, but couldn't put anything together that was satisfying.  I am not saying it can't be done, I was just having trouble and got discouraged.  I spent a lot of afternoons very sad after disappointing meals.
      
      Oh, and I will unlikely be thinking of you without reference to your "softer" skin for some time now.

    message: Try oat milk too, it has a creamy feel. Me I'm back on half n half in tea/coffee.

      Dagny - I've heard that you can make nut milk by adding nut butter to water, thought I use the old-fashioned method in which I use raw nuts. 
      
      Joel - Yes, I am like feminine beauty commercial with my softer skin. And I hear you about the need to do a lot of reorg. Parts of my diet have gotten a little worse since quitting dairy, but I'm confident I will eventually get it all back. I think the closer to vegan you get, the more you have to use whole grains and beans to get that "full" feeling back. And I'm not going to make a big deal about a little parmesan in a salad. The goal is to have as little dairy as possible and still be happy.
      
      Renee - Isn't it funny that cream in the coffee is the hardest part of giving up dairy? It really takes the fun out of coffee to have it black.

    message: For me, it isn't worth having without creamer. I was off coffee for so long, but I have had a few cups of decaf recently. I'm a social coffee drinker.  I like the nutbutter/nutmilk only when its going to be used as the base of a smoothie not on its own.

Once you get over the sharp different-ness of coffee with agave and brazil nut milk, it's actually pretty good.
