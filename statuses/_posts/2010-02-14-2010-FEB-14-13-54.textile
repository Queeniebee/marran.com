      I agree with your conclusion, if not your premises.  Perhaps you can't buy love, but I am not entirely sure you can't buy happiness.  Or, as deftly presented by the Simpsons (when Kent Brockman won the lottery).
      
      Homer: Well, he may have all that money, but there is one thing he can't buy.
      
      Marge: (Annoyed)  What.  What. What can't he buy?
      
      Homer (Thinking):  A dinosaur!
