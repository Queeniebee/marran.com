      "The Cone Gets The Royal Seal of Approval": 
      
      Prince William's girlfriend Kate Middleton was reportedly seen buying The Cone in Ann Summers Soho, London just before Christmas. Apparently bought with a sexy Santa outfit, it looks like Prince William was in for quite a treat over Christmas! Let's hope The Cone got a Royal Seal of approval!

I asked my massage therapist for advice on combating knots in my shoulders. He suggested a device that's a silicone pyramid. It turns out he meant this: http://www.conezone.info/ WARNING: link goes to a tame, but adult-themed site
