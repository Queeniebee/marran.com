    message: Toad often seems affable when he's in the company of lefty talk show hosts. He's a mighty charismatic fellow. How else would one manage serial marriages and become speaker of the house with those looks?

      Colbert was trying his damndest to needle Newt, but he couldn't do it. Newt cheerfully avoided it all. 
      
      I have to remind myself that I am not really capable of being inauthentic. But other people are not only capable of it, but very good at it. And they go into politics.
