    message: I actually loved it - although I didn't expect to.  Great gritty camera work and not as much reliance on music to cause the tension which made it feel like we were watching a documentary at times.

      Loved it. Saw it in a packed house and you could hear audible gasping at certain tense moments. A physically exhausting and emotionally draining film. It deserved all the awards it won. I think the "war film" is an inherently depressing genre.
