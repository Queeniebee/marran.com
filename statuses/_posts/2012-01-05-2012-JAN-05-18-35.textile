    message: I have occasionally thought about buying a tortilla press because homemade tortillas really are that much better than store-bought. But that's a level of gaydom I'm not sure I want to hit just yet.

    message: LOL!  Keith you are too funny!  I make a mexican lasagna.  You layer alternately a meat mixture consisting of Hamburger, tomato sauce, and seasoning, with layers of cheese, flour tortillas, and olives.  It's really easy and very yummy!  Just put it in a casserole dish, and bake for about 20 minutes, just until the cheese is melted.  You are basically using the tortillas in place of the noodles.

    message: There is nothing gay about knitting! Soldiers in WWI and WWII used to knit their own gloves, hats, and scarves. And remember, Jamie Lee Curtis was almost able to stop Michael Meyers by jamming knitting needles in his neck. Hmm...maybe if I saw someone take down a horror movie monster with a tortilla press, I'd feel more butch about owning one.

      I am pretty sure someone died from a tortilla press in El Mariachi.  Or maybe from Dusk till Dawn.
      
      And besides, I am pretty sure some soldiers in WWI and WWII engaged in gay sex, but that doesn't make it any less gay.  :-)

Why did I buy tortillas?! Because now I'm starving waiting for David to come home and I can hear the muffled cries of the tortillas from inside the refrigerator - beckoning to be eaten.
