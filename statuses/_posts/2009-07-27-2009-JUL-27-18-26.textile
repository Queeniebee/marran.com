    message: It's funny to see all the status updates of Oregonians bitching about the heat. I'm sure it sucks, but the weather is generally so enjoyable in Oregon (compared to NYC) that it's hard for me to feel sympathy.

I have been caught in 3 downpours in the past 2 days and I'm getting pretty sick of it.
