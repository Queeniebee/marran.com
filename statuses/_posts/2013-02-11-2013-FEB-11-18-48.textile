    message: I don't know if you're joking about the microwave cakes or not... but
      supposedly they turn out great as long as you use a siphon to put the batter
      in the cake pan. I will definitely be trying them out at some point.

link-info: A friend got me the cookbook "Modernist Cuisine at Home" for the holidays.
  At first, I was less than thrilled to receive yet another cookbook, but after I
  opened it up, I couldn't put it down.
