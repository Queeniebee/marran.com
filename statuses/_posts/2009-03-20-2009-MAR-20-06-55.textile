      It's a hardcore 1980 horror movie - the best of the Italian cannibal movies (yes, Virginia, there is a genre). I don't really recommend it to anyone. It's one of those movies that leaves you feeling awful about life. 
      
      There's a wikipedia entry if you want to know more, but be prepared to think less of me when you realize that I spent an evening watching such trash.
