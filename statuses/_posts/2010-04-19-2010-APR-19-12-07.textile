    message: That used to be my attitude. Lifting weights gave me a huge appetite and I would give in to it. And as a consequence, I gained weight. I an now attempting to spiritually embrace hunger and craving as a good thing.

    message: Try just a small portion of a protein drink (Naked Protein works great - the small size).  Reasonable calories, puts protein in, and takes the edge off.....

Second day back at Aerospace. I didn't feel like throwing up this time, but now I am ready to eat everything in sight.
