    message: Well...you're right. I had very low expectations and was surprised that
      the music was so good. Perhaps I didn't mind the book so much because it was
      done at Encores - the dated, creaky book just seemed like dated, campy fun.

    message: also, a stage reading is different than a full production. Also, the
      writers weren't allowed to use the full range of characters. So they were limited
      in what they could put in the show.
