    message: I like it!  Graphic, a touch retro.  Who says the husband gets a say in decorating?  Repeat after me "Don't worry about it, write the check."  Repeat as needed until you feel properly nested!

      The second I saw that wallpaper, it was a done deal in my head. I may still try to convince David. He forgets that when people see the rooms that I've made most of the decisions on, people ooo and ahh. He once seriously got upset with me after people wouldn't stop raving about the X-Men bathroom - and that was a room in which I blatantly refused to budge on my design. 
      
      Maybe I'll order a sample and just tack it to the wall for a while and see if I can wear him down...
      
      When else are you going to walk into a room with Art Nouveau wallpaper of octopi and jellyfish?!

      Look, octopi and jellyfish are apriori cool.  Add a genuinely cool and thoughtful design and color scheme you are charting new waters.
      
      Is that expensive for wallpaper?  I have never bought any.

      Yes, it is very expensive. My office took 6-8 rolls, I believe and my office is small. And I think I spent around $20/roll. So at $180 per roll, to do the largest room in the house would be - yes - terribly expensive. So maybe I'll cool it with the wallpaper until next year.
      
      I still ordered a sample. Just to see it.

    message: I think it's fabulous. I'm surprised it's so polarizing. Tacking up a sample is a good idea. I do that often and after a few weeks discover that I have a fickle heart.
