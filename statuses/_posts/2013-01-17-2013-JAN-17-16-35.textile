    message: Because I do browsing in the morning and maybe find a couple of things worth sharing. They get better reach if I space them out rather than send them all at once. That's the theory at least.

    message: That kind of makes sense. What about what you did here, where you used Buffer to post something that sounds pretty real-timey? (If you don't want to discuss this from your TROPICAL PARADISE, I would understand).

    message: "Anything to distract me from the crying babies until take off is good. There are two buttons on Buffer: share now or buffer. So if its real time, I send it right to Facebook and twitter."
