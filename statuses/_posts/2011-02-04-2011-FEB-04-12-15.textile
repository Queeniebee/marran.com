message: I have to make dinner for small gathering (<15 people). It has to be vegetarian and be relatively kid friendly. I kinda wanted to make good mac & cheese. I can't think what else to serve with it. Maybe tomato soup? Maybe a baked eggs dish (with spinach?)? Any suggestions?

    message: Veggie Lasagna with garlic bread is always an easy feast. Opening with Veg Minestrone and Grape juice for the yougins. Chianti for the adults.

    message: Kirsten and and I are discussing your dilemma. We say we like the mac n cheese.  But you need some veg to lighten it up, something decidedly un-creamy.  Roasted veggies?  Salad?  Like roasted brussels sprouts with balsamic? Or maybe sauteed kale and white beans? This recipe is so good! http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/aarti-sequeira/greens-n-beans-recipe/index.html

    message: spaghetti bolognese with TVP ( textured vegetable protein instead of beef) . Tastes like the real thing and my kids love it ! also little egg casserole (w/eggs or similar) in a 12 muffin pan, with indeed spinach, tomato cheddar or swiss. It small , very colorful and kid friendly. Adults can add tabasco ! there is a wold of possibilities...and if you want to cook with Tofu...then it is never ending...

    message: All good suggestions so far. I had not considered making baked eggs in a muffin pan for a group. That's a great idea. I'm now thinking minestrone with a ton of veggies, mac & cheese, and baked eggs with spinach and tomato and a little cheese on top.

    message: Def if you are making something heavy like mac and cheese start with something light and cool.  Salad with vinaigrette; tomato salad w/ cucumbers?  I've been digging on pears in salads lately.  The sweetness really counters a nice balsamic dressing

    message: lentil and ricotta patties can be placed in a burger bun and eaten like a hamburger or made into little bite size balls as a starter. Add a little curry to the mixture before cooking and they're yuuuummm!!

I have to make dinner for small gathering (<15 people). It has to be vegetarian and be relatively kid friendly. I kinda wanted to make good mac & cheese. I can't think what else to serve with it. Maybe tomato soup? Maybe a baked eggs dish (with spinach?)? Any suggestions?
