I tried a white chocolate ganache and it tasted bland and slightly unsettling. Now I'm trying a nougatine.

    message: Have you tried soaking the mac nuts and whipping them into cream in the highspeed blender?Then flavor, use a little coconut oil and when it is refrigerated it should be a scoopable cream you could coat in chocolate.

    message: It turns out the lemon myrtle needed more sugar. The nougatine solved it. Thanks for the help, though!

    message: Are you using the lemon myrtle leaves or oil? You can also buy it ground. Interesting to know how it worked out. Where are you sourcing it?

    message: I want to know where you get mostarda di frutta for those tortelloni.  Also, can you repost the recipe you used?

    message: "I'm using the lemon myrtle leaves. I got them from a tea company in the U.S. We just finished that batch and it turned out great. I can send you a recipe for macadamia and lemon myrtle brittle. "

    message: "Renee, I'll post the recipe for tortelli do zucca next week. We get mostarda do frutta at an Italian import store a block from our house. There's got to be an online source for it. I think it's great. I chopped it up and used it to glaze acorn squashes for Thanksgiving. "

I'm trying to make a decent chocolate filling out of lemon myrtle and macadamia nuts and so far it ain't happening. If any of my friends down under could provide a suggestion, I'm all ears. I tried a white chocolate ganache and it tasted bland and slightly unsettling. Now I'm trying a nougatine.
