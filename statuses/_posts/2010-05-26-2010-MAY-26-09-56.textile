      Joel - the book is a lot of fun. It's \"Invisible Monsters\" by Chuck Palahniuk. Though it is not as well written as \"Fight Club\" or \"Survivor\", I think it is his most outrageously chaotic and joyously self-destructive book. I haven't really enjoyed any of his other books besides the 3 I just mentioned. "

Betty complimented me on my beautiful t-shirt. I decided not to tell her it's about a book in which a model decides to shoot her face off.
