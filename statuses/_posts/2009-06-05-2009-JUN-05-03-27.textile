    message: The phrase you are looking for, if you don't already have it sorted out, is "un letto matrimoniale" followed by "si, per due uomini".  Translation services provided gladly as needed. Just text me.

      Ah, thanks for the info Tommaso. We were able to deduce the meaning. We had someone in Paris of all places that INSISTED that we did not understand what we were asking for. She gave us the room and said "I give you one bed. You look at room, then come back and we fix it. "
      
      And Mike- thanks for noticing my subtle attempts at making Facebook a potty mouth experience.
