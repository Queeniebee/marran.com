  I ordered a new computer last week (first one in 5 years!). I've been trying to stop myself from hitting the refresh button on the FedEx tracking page every 5 minutes. Trying and failing. 
  
  It's been over 48 hours of "In transit from Reno, NV." I hope it's not sitting drunk in a casino in Reno.

    message: "It is a top of the line iMac: quad-core, solid state drive, magic trackpad, etc. I was really excited about it, but now that Vero has pointed out that it might be selling itself to pay off gambling debts in Reno, I'm not sure if I'm as excited. The thought of everyone else's fingers all over its keyboard? Shudder."
