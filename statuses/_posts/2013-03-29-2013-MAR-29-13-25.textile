      for the onslaught of instantaneous congestion & eye watering which accompanies
      spring allergies.

    message: Exactly! I was in the city today with family and we were all covered
      up in winter clothes. It was quite windy in the evening too, but there were
      a horde of folks in shorts / short skirts and no coat on. This was mildly surprising,
      and I thought I must be really out of touch with the  city scene.

I've seen people in shorts, in flip-flops, and lined up for ice cream. The temp is in the forties. It must be Let's Pretend It's Spring Day.
