    message: A few years back I was watching the Rose Parade when I heard the strains of "Africa" behind the umpteenth rendition of "Louie Louie" by a high school band. It turned out to be the actual lead singer of Toto on a float in the Portland Grand Floral Parade singing Africa over and over again as they tootled up Alder. It was awesome.

For the 3rd time, I've had to listen to Toto singing about the rains in Africa in my local grocery store. What do they know about Africa?
