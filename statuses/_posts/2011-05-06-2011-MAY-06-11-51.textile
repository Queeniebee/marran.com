    message: Well...two attempts and two batches of olive oil soup. I'll try again another day and use a whisk instead of an immersion blender. And I will add the olive oil painfully slowly.

    message: Whiz it up in the food processor, and drizzle the oil slowly through the little opening in the top. Should come together and thicken up easily.

For years I have thought of making my own mayonnaise. I'm about to go for it using the Alton Brown recipe and adding garlic and herbs.
