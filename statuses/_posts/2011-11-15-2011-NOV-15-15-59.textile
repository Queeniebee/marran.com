link-info: "Feast your eyes on this: KitchenAid Brazil is offering a classic mixer in a variety of patterns, but none quite as exciting as this Wonder Woman homage. As someone who has taken a serious interest in cooking over the past year and is looking to get into baking next, this seems like the perfect gift!"
