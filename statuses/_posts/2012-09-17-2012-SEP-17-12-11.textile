    message: Joel - the moral of Hellraiser was that no matter what you did to accidentally summon demons, there's always someone else more deserving of endless torture that you can pawn them off on. So I wasn't worried.

      I don't know, man.  We always assume that we are at the beginning of a horror movie.  How could you be sure the movie hadn't been going on for 90 minutes and you were the hapless last person to get the box, aka, the "person more deserving of endless torture."
      
      Can you ever know?

David brought me a Hakone parquetry puzzle box from Japan. It requires 10 steps in sequence to open. They're awesome! (no cenobites appeared when I finally solved it.)
