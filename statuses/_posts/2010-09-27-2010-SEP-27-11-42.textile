    message: I loved that play and still think about it with some frequency.  How did that bit of awesomeness comes about?

      Thanks, Joel. The stage manager from the Knox production is now a theater professor at Bethany College. I think some of her students got into Pier Paolo Pasolini, the play came up in conversation, and she asked me if they could do it. That's about as much as I know. I'm sure the whole story is more interesting.
      
      I reread it a year or so ago. It feels like it ends with about 1/4 left to go. I could never figure out what that final bit is. Maybe I'll be inspired when I see it.

    message: That is great, Keith!!  I had wondered what happened to Tracie. I had heard she was in grad school a while back.  Which Bethany?   There are many around.

    message: I wish I had some work stashed in a drawer that suddenly became of interest. If that sounds like jealousy try instead to think of it as awe at the novelty of such a charmed event. Ahhh.

A play that I wrote in college "The Trial of Pelosi" is being done at Bethany College. How exciting! I can't wait to see it.
