    message: And what did you think?  (Just curious... I've never watched a single episode but always hear people raving about the show in general.)

    message: I thought it was a great finale. I could see where some people wouldn't like it, but I found it very moving. That show will rank up at the top of my list of best things I've ever watched.

    message: Would you say it "answered all questions"?  (Glad to hear you liked it.  And you're not the first I've heard to rank it that high.)  :]

    message: Agree, Keith.  I know some people might be disappointed, but I found it remarkably moving.  Love the debate that exists about the final few minutes - that is a great lasting legacy as well.....

    message: It did not answer all my questions. It didn't even try, really. But I sort of accepted a while ago that they were not going to wrap everything up about the island. It's all about the characters - and they did essentially wrap up all the characters' lives.

    message: My reason for watching would be to wrap up the mysteries of the island, so to speak...  thanks for the replies.  :)
