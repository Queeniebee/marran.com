    message: You can do it, Tom! At the risk of sounding...well, gay...I was inspired by the finale of Ugly Betty. I decided I needed to be naive, courageous, and blindly optimistic. It got me through the door.

    message: LOL.  Very gay (not that there's anything wrong with that!).   So - here's the plan.  I'll veg on the couch and catch up on the last 5 episodes of Ugly Betty to see if I can catch the same motivation :-)
