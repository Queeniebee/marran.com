    message: I just heard last night from someone who did marketing research for it.  Said it's crap.  It's just a GIANT iTouch.  You are restricted as to what Apps you can get for it, can only run one App at a time and it has no direct input lines (USB type) and a host of other crappy stuff...  wait for the next gen or another company's version ;)

    message: "Yeah - I've heard all those complaints. A giant iPod Touch sounds awesome. I don't need to run multiple apps at one time. I don't need USB. I don't need Flash. I want a machine that's light for travel, for watching video, reading eBooks, playing games, and staying current on email. I think people that expect it to be a jack-of-all-trades machine are missing the point. "

    message: Very well then.  ;)   I'm going to wait for something more "jacked" since I don't even need it in the first place, if that makes any sense.

    message: I must agree that GIANT iPod Touch sounds perfect for me too.  I think it will be very useful for travel or even just to read magazine or book on the train.  I don't need extra keyboard or flip it open like other notebook or netbook.

    message: Keith, I'm thinking about getting one also.  Not for travel but for work.  I spend all day running from client to client and what do I really do ... take notes, check off items on a to do list, send and receive email, and research on the web.  I think it would be perfect.  I do not need a full laptop to to do the work that I do.  My laptop, plus all of the other stuff I carry all day is getting heavy! I really want to get my hands on it!
