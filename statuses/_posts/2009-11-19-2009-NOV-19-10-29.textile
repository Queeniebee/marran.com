    message: Just READING "Susan Sarandon" and "Toucha Toucha Toucha Touch Me" made me smile. Rocky Horror in the Bollywood room??!

    message: I have been thinking about the "You're a hotdog, but you'd better not try to hurt her!" bit the last few days.  Man.  Has there ever been a soundtrack just bursting with melodies like that one?

    message: "It's been fun reuniting myself with the soundtrack (I have had the Original Roxy Cast for years). But the surprise for me was \"Over at the Frankenstein Place\". It's an unexpectedly beautiful song amidst all the up-tempo kitsch. "

    message: Funny... I've heard it many many times over the course of "since then" - in fact, it's mentioned in my last book :)

    message: Well, I've always thought "I'm coming home" and "Superheros" were beautiful.  You can tell me they were supposed to be kitch, but I won't believe it.  Just gorgeous.
