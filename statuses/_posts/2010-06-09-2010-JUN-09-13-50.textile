      Well, it won't be done until late August. But I'm pretty excited. I'll be able to wear the kilt casually around town or with the whole suit. I got the official NYC tartan.
      
      Here's a link to the store I visited: http://www.21stcenturykilts.com/
      
      He's done kilts for rock stars, fashion designers, all sorts of people. Vin Diesel wore one of his kilts to an awards ceremony.

    message: "The tailor is the son of one of the long-time kilt shops in the city. He started his own store about a year ago when he wanted to do more hip and modern kilts. He designs for fashion designers and celebrities. It's not your typical kilt shop.\n\n\
      I had no idea where to start when I walked in. We spent about an hour picking out fabrics and things.\n\n\
      There's an official NYC tartan, so I went with that. The accessories include a super cool shoulder holster for carrying cell phone, id and money; a bright orange airplane-buckle belt to use in place of a sporran (no fuzzy-animal-pelt sporrans for me); and instead of a dagger for the kilt pin, I'm getting a lightning bolt. He's picking out socks to match for me. The flashes will match the kilt. The jacket and waistcoat are made out of a different fabric that complements the kilt.\n\n\
      Once I saw how insanely comfortable kilts are, I wanted to switch from cargo shorts to kilts for my standard summer dress. Since everyone outside of Scotland thinks you have to be Scottish to wear a kilt, David and I have invented My Scottish Grandmother - Claire MacGregor.  "

I had full intentions of getting just a kilt. I walked out having ordered a hand-stitched kilt, jacket, and waistcoat, plus accessories.
