  As I watched two strangers get into a near fight on the sidewalk, I thought about how the oppressive heat is making New Yorkers irritable and ready to pounce. And not even a block later, I found myself shouting in the face of a driver that had cut off pedestrians so she could zoom across a cross-walk with it's white walk sign displaying.
  
  Here's hoping we get some rain soon.

      My encounter felt more like that scene in "The World According to Garp" when Garp tracks down the guy that always drives his truck too fast in his neighborhood. He takes a crowbar to the truck and shouts about how it's a residential neighborhood with kids running around and the driver should be more considerate.
      
      But yes, "Do The Right Thing" is very apt. The whole city feels like that right now.
