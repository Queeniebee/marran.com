    message: Yeah. I think she's great, but watching the trailer, she doesn't look
      unpopular enough

    message: I'm not even sure how Sissy Spacek pulled it off, but she did. She had
      a hint of stupidity about the world that made you understand that people just
      kind of hated her for no reason. Apparently she showed up at auditions with
      vaseline in her hair, no makeup, and old clothes to look like a rag.

      eyes. Chloe in the trailer just looks like a pretty girl who needs a brush.

Does Hollywood not understand that the story of "Carrie" is about the MOST unpopular girl in school? And that there is no way that Chloë Moretz would EVER be a candidate for that position?
