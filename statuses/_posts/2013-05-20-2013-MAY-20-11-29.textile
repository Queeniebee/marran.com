    message: Oh Keith, I want to fly to NYC right now desperately to help you out!
      Recipes have about 30% to do with it, the rest is temperature and time and how
      you roll. Getting those things across in a book is really hard and probably
      why people still have trouble with them. You need a physical demo to really
      grasp it, and of course, I'm the ONLY one qualified for it, BLAST! I'll be in
      NYC in late June; hold off on your pies til then :)

My kingdom for a pie crust recipe that doesn't split, tear, and stick while rolling out. I have tried to make pies many times and have yet to succeed.
