  You can complain all you want about Mac users being a cult, but if you've never experienced their customer service, you really shouldn't throw stones. 
  
  My trackpad started acting up. I made an appointment at the Genius Bar for that day. There was no wait when I showed up. And they gave me a brand new trackpad in 10 minutes.

    message: I totally agree. Tool my daughters iPhone in last night. She got it wet. Even though it was her fault they swapped it out for a new one at no charge!  Love their customer support....dislike teenagers that take iPhones to the pool!
