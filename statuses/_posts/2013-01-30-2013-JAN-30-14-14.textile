    message: I have the DoDo hardcover case (JCrew sells them or you can order online).
      Looks like an old school journal and may be too bulky but it makes for a great
      case if you carry it around a lot (not in a bag) or when using it as a reader.
      I love mine.

Does anyone have an iPad case/holder that they love? I have the Smart Cover and it is ... not so smart.
