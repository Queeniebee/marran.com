      This is mine and I love it. The Moshi ones are pretty cool, but they have a huge selection at TekServe.

    message: I have the DoDo hardcover case (JCrew sells them or you can order online). Looks like an old school journal and may be too bulky but it makes for a great case if you carry it around a lot (not in a bag) or when using it as a reader. I love mine.

    message: I got a cheapo one that was pretty sucky until I added a Velcro attachment to keep it in place. Then it was great.

Does anyone have an iPad case/holder that they love? I have the Smart Cover and it is ... not so smart.
