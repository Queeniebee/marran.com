    message: Keith, do you remember the time we went into Fred Meyers, and staged a fight?  That just came to mind.  We would act like we just broke up.  Those were great times!  That, and the cannery, and Rocky Horror picture show at the clinton street theater.  We had some good times! Next time you're in town, I would love to get together with you!

      By the time I was a senior in college, I had honed my \"misbehaving in public\" skills. "
