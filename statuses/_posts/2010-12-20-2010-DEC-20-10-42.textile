message: Our 10am flight to London was cancelled, so David called and got us on a 7am flight instead. Since we can't get to Rome through London, we are making the obvious route of NYC to Miami to The Dominican Republic to Madrid to Rome. Some how we will actually arrive in Rome sooner than our original flight. And we are business for the overnight flight, so I'm not complaining.

    message: I hope not. Being stranded in London for a day or two would be preferable to that series of flights.
