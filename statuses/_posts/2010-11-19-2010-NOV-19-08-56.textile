    message: "I will send you the itinerary as well as the contact of our guides. They know all the best local guides. Our guides for the Taj Mahal and Khajuraho were almost as enthralling as the sites themselves. "

We are now in Varanasi at the Hotel Ganges View. There are chanters and drummers outside the hotel. The hotel itself is stunning -google it. We have three nights left before coming home and I feel like a kid that sees back-to-school ads and realizes that summer is almost over.
