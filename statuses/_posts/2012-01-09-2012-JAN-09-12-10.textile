    message: "What?!  No Dairy Queen ice cream cake with sprinkles?!  But seriously: How about a flan with strawberries from Oregon and French custard?"

    message: If only I could get berries from Oregon. They are woefully deprived of good berries on the East Coast. It's maddening. The strawberries are usually good for two weeks during the peak of the season. Every time I go back to the West Coast, I get to remind myself of what blackberries are supposed to taste like.

    message: Something boozy with a hint of salt. Maybe vanilla and bourbon with salted caramel?

I have a birthday coming up and I have not given one thought to what sort of cake I want to make for myself. Suggestions are encouraged.
