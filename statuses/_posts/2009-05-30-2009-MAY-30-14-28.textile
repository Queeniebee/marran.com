    message: Looking forward to it.  Pixar has never done me wrong before (though I thought "Cars" was fun, but subpar on the writing.)  In case you were wondering, Pixar films are a boone to parenting.  Animated films that actually don't get that tiring after watching 100x.

      When we were looking for a time to go, Jeff was concerned that there would be too many kids at a matinee. I said that for Pixar films, you don't have to worry. The kids are too transfixed to make a noise. And that was true.
      
      And Tom - do you really read dripping sarcasm into all of my posts? Like I'm some sort of elitist monster? I always assumed that people said things behind my back like "That Keith is the most genuine and sincere person I know".

Just saw Pixar's Up. It's as thoroughly an enjoyable movie as you could hope for in a summer blockbuster.
