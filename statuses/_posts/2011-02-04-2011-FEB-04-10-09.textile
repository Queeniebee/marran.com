      There were several things that all modern musicals do that I don't like: Everything is a song. There are some moments that should have been a well-written scene, not a song. Everything is played at 100% hit-you-over-the-head level, so you can't tell the difference between a small moment and the climax of the show.
      
      I had heard that the problem is with the score. Not so. The music was good, not great, and had some very fine moments. A couple of the songs would have been fine if performed by U2 and perfected in a studio, but in a live setting done by non-mega-pop-stars, it just didn't translate as well. 
      
      The design, sets, and a stunts were AMAZING! The costumes, masks, and set design were fantastic. Dead on. The aerial stunts were breathtaking. Seeing Spider-man leap through the air was perfect and very spider-man-like. 
      
      They had to stop once to fix a technical problem. They had the show up and running in 5 minutes.
      
      However, the book is terrible. There are some glaring errors that being the whole play down to bad-student-production at times. I think Julie Taymor suffers from the "Emperor's New Clothes syndrome in which no one will tell her when something is just flat out bad. They needed a real playwright to whip it into shape. And besides some very specifically bad things, the entire second act is like being lost in a forest and thinking "Maybe this path will lead us home." 
      
      However, the stunts are so amazing that when you hear the music, and Spider-man flies to save Mary Jane, you forget everything bad about the show. 
      
      In general, when you try to re-invent something as iconic as Spider-man, you can change the content (within reason) but not the formula. And they lose sight of the formula in the second act.
      
      So...not a great show, but a flawed show with some breath-taking moments. I think it will run a while, but not pay back the investors.

    message: Especially the part about that the score is good... it's just meant for Bono to sing... quite interesting, but not unexpected, I guess.

I took my nephew to see "Spider-Man" on Broadway and he was beyond excited. As we shuffled into the theater with hundreds of other people, he said "All these people are here to see Spider-Man?" I said yes and got a little choked up sharing a Spider-Man moment with my nephew. I couldn't decide if it was because I was exhausted, or because I love my nephew, or because I'm a true comic book geek, or a big softie.
