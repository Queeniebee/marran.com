    message: It's like Shaun Cassidy. Didn't you have a mindblowing crush on Shaun Cassidy like everybody else? I did. I guess I just planted myself in the out of touch category with you though. Oh well. The more the merrier!

    message: "I was all ready to defend Shaun Cassidy. Then I did an image search and...um yeah. He was the 70's Justin Bieber: http://nothingfancy1.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/shaun-cassidy-1.jpg. I guess we can tell all the Justin Bieber fans that one day you will look back at your obsession and feel slightly embarrassed."

I'm completely out of touch with pop culture. Case in point: Justin Bieber. I don't get the obsession. Not in the slightest.
