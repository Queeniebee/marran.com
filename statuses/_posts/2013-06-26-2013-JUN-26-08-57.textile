    message: She has some hidden gems - no doubt about it. "Treat Me Right" is my
      personal fave.  "Shadows of the Night" is a great running song. You should play
      it at the 3/4 mark of your next half-marathon.

      Wat was the pat Benetar video/song that had an outro of a shirtless man playing
      a pink guitar in a headdress in a futuristic desert?  If no one can claim it,
      I''ll look for it later.  I may have some of the details a little wrong, but
      I swear that is the gist of it.'

Pat Benatar lost something in the transfer to digital music. It sounds too clean when listened to on headphones - as opposed to coming from a car radio, driving through the Bay Area in a beat-up Volvo, while singing at the top of my lungs. (my twenties were well-spent.)
