    message: To save myself the trouble, I just gave them everything I had of value - my checkbook, the deed to my house, the pink slips to our cars, and all my future earnings.  They wrote back and said that I still owed them everything I have of sentimental value as well - kids' drawings, photos, etc.  After I sent them all that stuff (postage paid, of course) they cited some obscure provision of the tax code and said that they needed to -- and had the right to -- punch me in the face.  I accepted those terms immediately as well and booked a flight to D.C.  Will give you further updates as this tense negotiation continues.

    message: Yes, Joel, please keep me posted. If I could end all of this with a punch to the face, I would jump at the opportunity. It's a small price to pay for the endless saga of paperwork.

I consider myself a sane, competent, and level-headed person. Why does that all come crashing down when it comes to preparing my taxes?
