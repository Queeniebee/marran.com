    message: I agree - what is that Butterfly effect going to be like - or is it affect - I can never get those two right :-)  Hope that doesn't spoil it for people that still have it on DVR.  I startled all the dogs with my loud gasp at the final scene.

    message: I don't think he's really dead. I think someone is going to save him. It was a great episode anyway - even before the last five minutes.

      Yea - loved how the entire episode played out.  Great character development/studies.  Blog theories so far are 1) L'il Ben has a twin, 2) the Island will bring him back to life (hey - it has to revive Locke, right?  RIGHT?), 3) the effect of that shot is arc'ed to the finale....and the series will end with the Oceanic flight landing in LA, and none of it ever happened.
      
      I love this stuff.

    message: I laugh at all those theories. My theory is that no one dies or gets resurrected by the island. They get displaced in time - to a time when they were alive.

      Here is total "counter theory"...
      I think some of the Others are already dead. I think that's what is required to become a true other. Alpert told child Ben to be patient and I think he was telling him that because he knew that it would be required that he die before he could join them. I think Sayid just gave Ben exactly what he wanted.
      
      Again - so much of the fun here is this mental masturbation.

      Here's the best I've read so far: http://www.docarzt.com/lost/lost-theories/lost-theory-little-ben/
      
      And it ties together some past episode events that I had totally forgotten.
