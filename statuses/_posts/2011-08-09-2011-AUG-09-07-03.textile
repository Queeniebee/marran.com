    message: Not perfect but really good. It was a huge help in our marriage in regards to talking about budget and it actually got me to care a little about having a budget. My husband was smart to make the budget like a video game for me. Highly recommend

      Caveats:  Mint is targeted-advertising-supported, so expect to be nagged about how you can get a better interest rate with a variety of partners.
      
      Also, they don't have significant competitors, so they don't implement user friendly features that don't serve their business model.  For instance, you can't import old transactions.  Forget about loading all of 2011 into mint and looking at your trends for the year.  If you care about that, you may want to wait until 2012 to switch to mint.

    message: That said, it's awesome. The automatic categorizing is very good - I only have to make one or two corrections a month.

    message: Well...firing up mint.com was as close to a bucket of ice water in my face as I can imagine. I think I was happier with my head in the sand.
