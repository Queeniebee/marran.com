      Just buy one of the tomato timers. That's it. Your productivity will increase.
      
      Seriously...I'm going to write a longer post about it later in the week. The book that I mention takes the basic concept and improves a little bit and really explains on a deep level why it works. They recommend a physical timer that you have to wind up rather than software because your brain enjoys the tangible act of winding it up and watching it count down.

    message: Cool.  Post something, I will definitely read it.  I am intrigued, as I often find myself overwhelmed by the hugeness and staggering diversity of tasks in front of me, I get exhausted before I begin, and tuck my tail between my legs and retreat.  If this method is about digesting and attacking the daunting world in limited increments, it might be my thing.
