    message: I doubt the exact same drink would taste as good if you weren't in Italy, dude. Know what I'm saying? Like the way beer tastes better in Germany. Context is everything.

    message: I think part of it is that they have never heard of the evil word non-fat.  But even an espresso at a stand-up bar jockeyed by a pimply-faced teen in Italy is so rich as to be almost chocolatey.  I do not understand.  Context helps, but it isn't everything.

    message: The rBGH in the milk here makes it taste awful; but try finding a cheap sandwich in Rome. I'll take cheap sandwiches and cancer any day. Oh wait. The reverse, I'll take the reverse.

    message: Espresso in Italy is qualitatively better and cheaper regardless of context. Same goes for mozzarella cheese.

Why is any cappucino in Italy cheaper and superior to anything you could get anywhere else?
