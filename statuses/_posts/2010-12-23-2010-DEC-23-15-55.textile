message: Tonight we ate at a restaurant not listed in any guidebook. In the same family for the past five generations, it was like something out of a Fellini movie. There was no menu - they served each dish prepared for the evening. At the end of the meal, I thanked the owner and told him that the food was excellent. He said, "No sir, it is a reaction that the food brings about. The enjoyment is in YOU."

Tonight we ate at a restaurant not listed in any guidebook. In the same family for the past five generations, it was like something out of a Fellini movie. There was no menu - they served each dish prepared for the evening. At the end of the meal, I thanked the owner and told him that the food was excellent. He said, "No sir, it is a reaction that the food brings about. The enjoyment is in YOU."
