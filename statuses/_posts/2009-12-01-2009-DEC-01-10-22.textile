    message: "That was the first \"album\" I ever bought. The vinyl was sold out so I got the 8 track. I'm rediscovering it vicariously. Don't Try Suicide\xE2\x80\x94awesome. While it might seem obvious, how about Crazy Little Thing Called Love? Sail Away Sweet Sister? Dubious. But I'll take it as part of the package:)"

      Looking back on it, I think my pre-pubescent mind could not make sense of Freddie Mercury at the time.
      
      I remember being transfixed by the video of Crazy Little Thing Called Love - his leather biker outfit, the clapping hands coming out of the stage...I can only guess how my mind filed those images away.
      
      And now when I listen to "Play the Game", I practically swoon like a 14-year-old girl. Freddie's smooth and breathy vocals seduce me every time.
      
      And I do love Sail Away Sweet Sister. I agree - is it a great song? No. But it fits in so well. And I love "Coming Soon" for no discernible reason.

      In that vein, I remember being in the caf, week 1 sitting with a young km who commented on the good looks of a collegiate foot ball player. I just thought. what a curious generosity of spirit that would let one teenage boy be so complimentary of another."
