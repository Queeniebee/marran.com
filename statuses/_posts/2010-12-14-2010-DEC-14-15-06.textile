    message: "It's based on the word \"bathos\" - which is emotion taken to the point of being laughable or unintentionally humorous. So bathetic is the adjective form. Sentence: \"I felt bad that the drag queen's wig fell off during the performance, but seeing her sobbing about it backstage is bathetic.\""
