    message: I'm a fan of the mustache too regardless of what pop culture terms Joel uses to diminish (inflate?) it. Nice hat.

    message: Nice hat and well done. It is understated yet the pop of orange adds vibrancy and versatility which makes it well suited for fall, winter, or spring.

      Keith, I almost thought it was someone else :D
      It's been so long and you look a world different with the 'stache. 
      Lovely hat in bright hues!

    message: Thanks for the compliments on the hat and the 'stache. I had been calling it my Rajasthani mustache, because that's where i was when I was inspired to grow it. Now I think I'll call it my pornstache. And Sarah - you had mentioned ravelry.com when I was having problems with gloves. It's a great site and I've been posting my projects.

    message: howdy! did you use circular needles to make the hat? I am about to tackle  my first beanie project with circular needles. Have a feeling I'll end up with a bright red tea cosy instead...
