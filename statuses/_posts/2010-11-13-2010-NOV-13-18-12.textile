    message: Stuffed animals? I initially had an image of you sitting among a whole load of teddy bears and such! :-) I'm guessing that's not what you meant though... Heehee!

    message: Which palace was this? WHen you get back stateside, would love to see your itinerary - we're planning to take the kids in December for their introductory trip to India.

    message: "This was in Karauli. The whole town was great - a fantastic old palace, a chaotic Krishna temple, a good bazaar, and a visit to a hand loom center. The people were super friendly and obviously rarely see westerners. I'll give you the whole itinerary when I get back. "

We had some power outages last night. We sat in the palace amongst stuffed animals lit by candelabras. When the power came back on we had a music and dance performance on the front steps.
