    message: check out monsters vs. aliens in 3d for an excellent use of San Fran for chase scene

    message: Have I seen "What's Up Doc?"?! I quote that movie on a daily basis. I torture David with excerpts.

    message: Foul Play and What's Up Doc are the best!!!  I miss those kinds of madcap movies.  They just don't make movies like that anymore.

    message: what's up doc is definitely as good as it gets in the ups-and-downs (mostly downs) department. also, madeline kahn is at her best. even streisand is less annoyingly annoying than usual.

    message: That's one of my favorite movies.  And little did I know when first seeing it that it uses (rather cleverly) the music from  one of my honey's favorite musicals - yes, in that great chase scene.
