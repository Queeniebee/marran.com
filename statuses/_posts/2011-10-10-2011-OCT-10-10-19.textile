      Some say love, it is a river
      That drowns the tender reed
      Some say love, it is a razor

    message: I tried to Google movie clips to see if the movie is worth seeing, but I was inundated with clips of Bette singing the main title in concert. Danielle - you sound like you're about to go all Tween Goth on me...

This weekend I rediscovered an album that was heavily played in our house when I was a kid: the soundtrack to the movie The Rose. Yay to forgotten gems.
