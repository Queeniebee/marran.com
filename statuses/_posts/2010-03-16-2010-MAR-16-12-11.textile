    message: "The Bhagavad Gita is an 18 chapter excerpt of the Mahabharata. It is beautiful, rewarding, and perplexing but extremely dense reading. It's more meaningful if you know the story of The Mahabharata and what is leading up to that moment of spiritual crisis. This book helped me put a lot of it into context: http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Hinduism-2nd/dp/1592579051. Personally, I would start there or you're liable to not be able to slug through The Bhagavad Gita. "

    message: You know what? I take it all back. Get The Bhagavad Gita. Even if you don't read it start to finish, it's a good book to have on your shelf.

      I find the Vedas and Upanishads to be very difficult reading. If I had a guru or Hindu professor to lead me through them, I might change my mind. 
      
      I'm assuming there was a time that someone sat in the suite reading the Upanishads for no particular reason?

    message: Yes & no.  A high school friend had a book of one-panel 'comics' and in it someone, sprawled on the couch, with a huge book, said into the phone "Oh, not much.  Just lounging around reading 'The Upanishads.'" I found it quite funny.  And thus, Craig and I kept a copy lying around... and yes, a few people picked it up and started reading it in a relaxed kind of way... :)

    message: Wow!! Good for you Keith! At various points in my life I was asked to read the BG, but  never got around it. Tantric Saivism sounds very interesting. I'm curious if it's more about Saivism or the Tantras?

I've tackled The Bhagavad Gita, a modern prose version of The Mahabharata, I'm moving on to a book about Tantric Saivism and Be Here Now.
