message: The Crystal Party is this Thursday. It's THE big Mount Sinai social event. David has told me that I can wear neither a kilt nor a dhoti. So I'm thinking of dressing up like the fifth member of Sgt Pepper's or picking an early look from David Bowie. Any suggestions?

The Crystal Party is this Thursday. It's THE big Mount Sinai social event. David has told me that I can wear neither a kilt nor a dhoti. So I'm thinking of dressing up like the fifth member of Sgt Pepper's or picking an early look from David Bowie. Any suggestions?
