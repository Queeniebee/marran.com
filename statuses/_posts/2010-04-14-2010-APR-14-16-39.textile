    message: I've enjoyed how they have been working in all the theories that have been floating around - "Alternate Universe", "Purgatory", a "Dream".  And I've also enjoyed how things have been starting to revolve around your one true love - very interesting...

    message: I don't believe in blind faith. Maybe that's why I lost interest in Lost a few seasons back.

    message: I don't believe in blind faith - but I do believe that the writers of Lost know where they're going. But...de gustibus non est disputandum.

    message: I read a while back that they had NO idea where they were going when they started. Let's hope that changed and the finale is satisfying!
