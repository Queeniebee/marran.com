    message: Does IAD have one of those mini-spas? I vote that you park it there during the wait. Like a true star. Your entourage can apprise you.

The standby lists for flights to NYC are well over 100 names long. Every one of these flights is like Oscar night when they start calling for standbys. I have to remember not to gloat and squeal too much if my name gets called.
