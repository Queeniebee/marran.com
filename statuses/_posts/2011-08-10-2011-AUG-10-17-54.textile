Email, FB and texting have done nothing to improve the situation.  I am a grammar grouch.

Do they teach the difference between "to" and "too" in school anymore? I'm not usually a stickler for grammar in casual internet comments, but I'm getting a little appalled that no one seems to use "too" anymore.
