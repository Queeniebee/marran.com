      Ben - I haven't made Kraft Mac & Cheese in eons. Though I occasionally search for a good homemade recipe, I have yet to find one.
      
      Rosie - These are ding dongs: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f_vuJiN9ZO8/TNYYwKKMpaI/AAAAAAAAB6o/LdaDrt7NxJY/s400/DingDongs.jpg
      
      I assume there's an Australian equivalent. They're sort of a universal concept in my mind.

I'm about to start a recipe that I've wanted to make for years: homemade ding dongs. I was going to make them root beer flavored, but David said I had to stick to chocolate.
