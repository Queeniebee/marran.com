    message: I stopped watching about 3 episodes into this season. I had turned to John and asked, "wait, is this evil future Peter? Or is it Peter from the past who is becoming evil?" It was such an absurd question that I immediately deleted the show from my tivo so no one would have to answer it.

    message: Don't know if this helps, but I figured out why Sylar's clothes would change when he morphed into someone else - he uses Candice's power for that (came to me 5 minutes into last night)
