    message: I'm assuming you're the Julia Child devotee?  You're cake was out of this world, totally amazing!

      Thanks, Robb. Eileen - Robb is the Julia Child devotee. In fact, we watched her episode on mousses the night before I attempted the mousse part of the cake.
      
      I love her haphazardness that someone ends in great food.

    message: Really, I never would have known Robb to be the Julia Child devotee.  While I've always envied your culinary skills, it's probably a good thing mine are much more limited... for my waistline.  :-)

      Nonsense! Most of the foodies that I know cook very healthy food. And I know people that have become masters of raw fruits and veggies for their meals. Don't be afraid of the culinary arts!
      
      I used to cook more desserts, though, and had to give it up. So I save it for special occasions now.

      Yup, Julia is one of my heroes. 
      Keith is too, of course.
