description: When people talk about travel, Italy comes up a lot. I always mention Rome which still stands out in my mind as a place I could see myself happily trapped in. A standard response I get is "Have you been to Florence? You haven't seen nothing yet."

David and I were trying to plan our big trip for that year. We looked at several options but either the timing didn't work out, or the flights getting there and back were too difficult, or the whole thing would have been too expensive. Then, all of a sudden, we over looked the obvious. Why don't we just go to Florence and spend a week driving around Tuscany? It was the perfect plan and ended up being one of the most perfect vacations I have ever been on.
