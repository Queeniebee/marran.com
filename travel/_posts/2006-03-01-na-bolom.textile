description: "Our hotel in San Crist\xC3\xB3bal was pretty incredible. We spent three nights at Casa Na Bolom which is a short walk from the center of town. Casa Na Bolom is a cultural center, a restaurant, a museum, a garden, a hotel, and a historical icon. All the rooms are individual and scattered throughout the estate, down hallways, across courtyards, up steps, etc. It's a huge area that I would stroll around and constantly find new little buildings or gardens hidden around a corner."

<p>Although our room was nice, on the last night we asked if we could try another room. We specifically asked for the room that Diego Rivera slept in on his trips to San Cristobal. It was another great room with a view of a garden.</p>
