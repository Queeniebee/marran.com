description: So we got to the hotel and packed. Nothing too eventful. The flight home was a little trying. The flight to Zurich was in front of two blabber mouths that couldn't talk below a shout. And American Airlines didn't have us sitting together on the way home. We were persistent in our complaining and eventually got two seats together. The flight felt very long on the way home.

<p>It turns out that I brought a friend home from Prague in my stomach. I couldn't go to work the next day - it felt like I swallowed glass. But after a day of rest, I was ready to go back to work. Well, as ready as I was going to get.</p>
<p>I left a lot of things yet to do in Prague. I found an antique map shop for David that he didn't have time to visit, so there's something calling David there, too. I will never pass up a trip to Prague.</p>
