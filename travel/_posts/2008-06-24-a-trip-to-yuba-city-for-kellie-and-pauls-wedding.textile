description: In June 2008, Mom, Dad, Sis, Lorenz, and little old me rendezvoused in Yuba City. The event that brought us there was the wedding of my cousin, Kellie Everett (Parke's daughter). It gave us a chance to visit Buck's Lake, where Parke has a cabin that's been in the family for decades, hang out in Yuba City, visit Uncle Scott, and have a good ole Everett time.You will notice that Aunt Catherine is in more than her fair share of photos. That's because she's a ham. Plus, she's photogenic.Enjoy the photos.
