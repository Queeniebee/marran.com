We went to the South of France expecting cold and dour people and sunny weather. We got just the opposite. Nice was once part of Italy, and we began speculating that when the Italians handed Nice back to France they said, "We'll give you Nice back, but you have to be friendly to the tourists and serve lots of pizza." However, the same was true for all of Provence-the people could not have been friendlier. I guess my only exposure to French culture so far has been the Parisians where the rule is to be snooty to the tourists.The weather was...not as bad as it could have been. There was only one day that was continually rainy. Most days were nice in the mornings with a little drizzle in the afternoon. We were there in April, so what can you expect? (State the previous sentence with a Yiddish inflection.)
