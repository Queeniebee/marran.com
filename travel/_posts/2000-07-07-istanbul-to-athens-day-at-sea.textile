<p>We did meet someone on the ship - That night we were enjoying the bough of the ship as we sailed into the night and a blond woman carrying a book, a glass of wine, and a cigarette came out to where we were and we got to talking. Her name is Pam and she's here with a large group, many of whom are anesthesiologists. Later in the trip, Pam became an invaluable source of gossip and amusement about a leathery, blond woman who was at least 50% silicone that walked around in a yellow thong bikini. We all had different names for her - Pam called her "Barbie," others on the ship called her "Miss Las Vegas" and David and I simply called her "Boobs." I wish I had a good picture of her, but I could never work up the guts. She and her husband were often in the gym.</p>
