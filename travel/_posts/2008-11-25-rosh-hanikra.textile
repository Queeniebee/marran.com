description: "Our final stop on our day tour is a locale at the very northern tip of Israel: the [w:Rosh HaNikra grottoes]. You take a small tram down the side of a cliff to get to the grottoes. The cliffs are a beautiful white chalk and the Mediterranean feeds into the grottoes, making for great tourist photos."

Rosh Hanikra was the site where Israeli and Lebanese officials negotiated and concluded an armistice in 1949 which ended the Lebanese-Israeli component of the 1948 War of Israeli Independence.

You're essentially at the border of Lebanon. So I took a photo.
