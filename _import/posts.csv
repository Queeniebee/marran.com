&quot;Dramatic Prairie Dog - Where Have I Been?&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/animals/dramatic-prairie-dog-where-have-i-been&quot;;&quot;I happened to be served up the following video, which is by definition "cute", and I highly recommend it. However, what it led me to was the Dramatic Prairie Dog phenomenon. It's a simple shot of a prairie dog from a Japanese kid's show, but someone added a dramatic flourish of music. Here's the original video:

&quot;Crash Diet Weekends - pt. 1: Dairy Free&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/diet/crash-diet-weekends-pt-1-dairy-free&quot;;&quot;David is now traveling every weekend until February. Since I've been on a weight-loss kick, I've decided to take his absence to try a month of weekend crash diets. Every weekend, I'll pick a new theme. I should say that some of these are not crash diets but legitimate lifestyle choices. However, they are choices that I never thought I'd make, so I'm trying them out for a weekend since you can stick just about any diet for a weekend.

This is the first weekend and I've chosen to give up dairy. If I had a normally bad diet, I don't think giving up dairy would make a bit of difference, but I'm already on a pretty healthy and restrictive diet, so this is just the icing on the cake. It's a chance for my system to clean itself out. I tend to think that dairy slows down our digestive system and I think a good part of healthy eating is getting your body to be able to process food faster and more completely. I have also heard that people with dark circles under their eyes have a low-level dairy allergy, so I'm hoping to see a difference in my complexion.

I don't have a lot of dairy normally, but the dairy that I have is heavily ingrained in my routine, so I had to be able to substitute. For instance, I have milk in my morning protein shake and then my coffee. I'd have to change both of those things. I had tried soy milk several months ago and while I liked the taste, it was definitely not making my digestive system happy. So this time around I'm trying almond milk. I had some last night and was surprised how good the unsweetened kind is. At first it seems pretty watery, but the aftertaste has a delicious, nutty tang to it. So that's my substitute for milk.

I have recently gotten into a daily dose of yogurt. That's going to have to be replaced as well. I may try soy yogurt in the hopes that the enzymes in yogurt will balance out the issue of the digestive problems of soy. I've also stocked the refrigerator with watermelon, which is another healthy snack that I'll have in place of my usual yogurt snack.

I think the hard part will be salad dressing. I've been getting into salads a lot lately. Even a non-creamy cobb salad has blue cheese in it. I suppose that my salads will have to have oil vinegar dressing for the time being. Anyway, it's just for a weekend.

I'll be sure to do another entry next week to discuss any changes with a dairy free diet.&quot;;&quot;1200071518&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;I’m Not as Much Into You As You Are To Me&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/politics/i-m-not-much-you-you-are-me&quot;;&quot;I wish I had started keeping track of all the calls I've been getting from political candidates lately. It was at least five calls yesterday. They've all been democratic candidates. It makes me wish I had signed up as a republican, so I could have compared the average republican call to the average democratic call. Although, now that I think of it, why bother. They're all going to be the same.
<!--break-->

The Clinton calls go like this:
<blockquote>This is Hillary Clinton. In my XX years of EXPERIENCE bringing about CHANGE blah-blah-blah CHANGE blah-blah EXPERIENCE.</blockquote>
The Obama calls go like this:
<blockquote>This is Barak Obama. On February 4th, vote for HOPE and CHANGE blah-blah-blah HOPE blah-blah CHANGE</blockquote>
It really seems aggressively anti-substantive. I guess it's foolish to expect that they could say something of value in a 1 minute recorded voice message. But if they aren't going to say anything actually relevant or important, why bother me?

The whole thing is making me feel very...used. And creeped out.

I got an email from Obama yesterday that was titled: "One Last Thing..." Did he not get his message in the previous 2 emails he sent me that day? He starting to sound like someone that can't end a telephone conversation for fear I'll never call back.

I wish political candidates realized that they should be following dating rules. When you're in that initial dating phase and you aren't sure if you're going to go all the way, you would NEVER call someone that twice in one day! That would sound way too desperate and needy. I would have been happy to have a call on Friday from the candidates that went something like: "Hey. It's been great getting to know you. I hope we can continue our relationship. Have a great weekend. Call me if your bored." And then nothing until primary day.

They should let me have some time to sit and think about it, chat with friends at Sunday brunch, etc. The soonest they should call would be the eve of the primaries with a "Happy Primary Day. I've been thinking about you a lot lately. I hope you had a good weekend. Think of me at the polls."

The candidates have crossed over from courting me into stalking me. At this point, I'm looking for anyone that knows how to not sound desperate.&quot;;&quot;1202225195&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Am I the Lisa Simpson of Gay Men?&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/television/am-i-lisa-simpson-gay-men&quot;;&quot;One of the hardest things about getting older is that you can't tell if you're turning into a grumpy old crank or if you're just starting to notice how irritating the world actually is.

I just saw this commercial on Comedy Central. I found it offensive on so many levels. The most obvious and irritating thing about the commercial is that they equate meeting people with picking out clothes. They might as well be advertising crystal meth.

And I love the guy that they picked for "smart". I think I must have very different standards for what constitutes "smart".

So in the meantime, here's a video of our latest dance performance. Yours truly is the one shaking the finger at the dancer playing the little girl in the beginning. Then I re-emerge later.

This was a great performance. I had a lot of fun because there's a bit more acting, the choreography was not quite as demanding, and it had a creepy Halloween theme to it.

&quot;Raw Food&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/diet/raw-food&quot;;&quot;My friend, Renee, has been talking about raw food restaurants here in New York. She turned me on to one in particular, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.purefoodandwine.com/">Pure Food and Wine</a>. There's a little blurb on their website describing raw food.

Last night, we were looking for a restaurant to take a kosher friend to and I suggested that we try this place out. They had a sample menu online and everything sounded delicious by the description of things.

Our kosher friend, Sarah, upon hearing that we were going to a raw food restaurant said "Aren't there a lot of articles about raw food restaurants making people sick?" When we pressed her for more information, it turns out she was talking about a Sex and the City episode.

So we got there and I ordered a cocktail. It was good, but definitely felt light on the alcohol part. They use sake and prosecco for their main alcohol. I don't know what it is about sake that makes it more organic/raw than other alcohol.

The menu was different than what was on the web, but still as tasty-sounding.

When the food arrived, I was blown away. You would never be able to tell in a million years that there was no dairy - the food was so rich and creamy. I really don't know how they did the things they did.

Both the appetizer and the entree were extremely good. I was thinking that I might not fill up from eating there and was fully prepared to get dessert on the way home. But halfway through my entree, my stomach said "I'm filling up! Slow down!"

David and I decided to split a sundae for dessert. It was amazing. I never never never would have known that it was vegan. In fact, I preferred it to a regular dairy sundae because I didn't feel weighed down and bloated from eating it.

Even the kosher doubter had a great meal. She confessed that she was ready to harass me about the meal. But she left with a changed attitude and a happy palate.&quot;;&quot;1199017646&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Saw, the Musical&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/movies/saw-musical&quot;;&quot;I just saw <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sweeneytoddmovie.com/">Sweeney Todd</a>. I loved it. The filming is impeccable. The scenes of 19th century London are stunning. The story is captivating (they made some changes from the stage version that tightened it up).

I had read a review in The New York Times that said that it is as gory as Saw. I haven't actually seen Saw all the way through, though I think I can safely saw that it is not nearly as gory as Saw. In fact, the blood is too bright red to be realistic. It's meant to be over-the-top Grand Guignol. There are some big gross-out moments, of course, but it's always in Tim Burton style - meaning that it's effective, but cartoonish.

The acting is great. The singing is not as good as you'd like, but it's no surprise. Johnny Depp had a bit of a rock-and-roll flair to his singing, which I expected. He hit the notes better than I was expecting. But his acting is just so good, you have to forgive him.

I had seen a revival of Sweeney Todd last year on Broadway that was excellent. I really shouldn't compare the two, because there's no coming close to how talented the cast was in the stage version; however, the movie has one thing that I've never seen in a stage version of Sweeney Todd - it's creepy fun.

I really can't think of anyone that I wouldn't send to go see it.&quot;;&quot;1199060394&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Mac Attack&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/mac-os/mac-attack&quot;;&quot;I wish I were a stronger man. I wish I had more resolve. I wish I didn't get obsessed with buying the latest <em>something</em> and then spend my time pining away for it.

Somehow, a few weeks ago, I got obsessed with getting a Macintosh. I think it started with my interest in going open source. As I read programming manuals, I began to notice that the installation instructions for Mac were very brief. Many of them said - "If you have Mac OS X, this software is already on your machine". I had experimented with putting Linux on my machine, but when I saw how limited the software options were, I ran screaming. No Photoshop? No Illustrator? No iTunes?

Then it dawned on me...now that Mac OS X is built on top of Unix, you get all the benefits of open source development, with commercial software options and a really cool OS.

This started a period where I noticed everything that bugged me about my PC. I started to notice how poor my video and audio playback was on my PC. I would wait forever for the hard drive to finish spinning before the computer would come to life. A couple of weekends ago I tried to set up Drupal (open source content management system) on my home machine. I spent a better part of the weekend and couldn't make it work. It drove me crazy.

At that point, I was completely decided to get a Mac. It was just a matter of time. I felt like a consumate addict - every morning I told myself that today was really not the best day to get a Mac. Just be patient. Rise above your desires. You still can get everything done that you need to get done. None of it was working.

Eventually I got the call from my pseudo-employer that they would reimburse me for a Mac and the associated software I would need to get. Needless to say, I was off to the store to get my new Mac.

I got a 15", MacBook Pro. I spent extra for the faster processor, more memory, and bigger hard drive. I spent almost as much money on the software as I did on the hardware. By the time I got home, I was giddy with anticipation. I hate to admit it, but the Mac exceeded my expectations. I must have said "that is soooo cool" to myself three times in the first 15 minutes. Some of the cool factors are:
<ul>
	<li>I was trying to figure out where to plug the power cord in, when it leapt out of my hand and into its socket. Why? It's magnetic! All you have to do is get close to the slot! That way if someone trips over the power cord, the cord slips out of its slot without bringing the laptop crashing down.</li>
	<li>As part of the setup, it takes a picture of you to use with your profile.</li>
	<li>It automatically finds a nearby wireless connection during startup. It was downloading software updates in no time.</li>
</ul>
Within 30 minutes, I started to get feel like that Mac snobbery descend upon me. I had become part of the computer elite. I envisioned that all Mac users would someday settle our own planet like a Star Trek colony of peace-loving, creative, intellectuals.

It's sad that Macs will probably never break the barrier of market share. I think it will always remain a niche product. Maybe that's not so bad. But I feel bad for all those people out there that are missing out on a super cool computing experience.

And by the way, remember how I spent a weekend trying to get Drupal up and running on my Windows machine and gave up? I had it up and running within an hour on my new Mac.

&quot;A Summer Breeze…Came Blowin’ In…&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/beauty/summer-breeze-came-blowin&quot;;&quot;It appears that summer has hit here in NYC. It was in the 80's today.

I had to get my hair cut, and I was in one of those crazy moods. I decided to get it totally buzzed. I had been thinking about doing this for a while. I have a lot of friends that have their head shaved or closely buzzed, and I often think that they look best on the first day of the haircut. So I went to a barber and asked for a buzzcut - not completely shaved, but short. And I didn't look at it until he was done.

And a good thing, too. I had those five minutes to prepare a look of stony optimism to not to reveal to the barter that my world had crumbled on the inside.

I took a glance in the mirror at the end. It looked FAR WORSE than I would have imagined. Somewhere after paying and stepping out of the barber shop, I felt better. I caught a look of myself in the window, and it didn't look chemo-inspired, it looked military. I looked like a bad-ass.

I went to Whole Foods and no one pointed and laughed. No one came up to ask me what type of cancer I had. The breeze felt fantastic on my head. Why - I may just keep this haircut for a while!

I got home and wondered if the pups were going to sniff my head, wondering what happened. Oz was fine. Gogo took a look at me and went nuts. She got all excited and even gave me TWO KISSES! Maybe girls dig military haircuts.

I was feeling pretty gosh-darn great about the haircut when I took a serious look in the mirror. It's not good. It's somewhere in between escaped mental patient and just-got-home-from-the-hospital. I'm hoping in a couple of days it will have grown out enough to be passable. For the time being, I'm going to have to wear a hat - at least when I'm with David.

I was planning on taking a picture for this entry, then chickened out when I tried to take a decent shot. I finally decided to be brave, but so as not to horrify people when this page loads, I've hidden the picture.

NOTE: After some consideration, I've decided I'm not brave. I took down the photo.&quot;;&quot;1180128537&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;

Luckily, that's where my head is 80% of the time and I laughed quite hardily at almost all of these. I read it a second time after working until midnight. Working late definitely helps put you in the right mood to find this funny.

&quot;Why There Are No Updates&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/hosting/why-there-are-no-updates&quot;;&quot;Normally, you can chalk up my lack of recent blog entries to laziness. Well...maybe that's too harsh. Distractions is perhaps a better word. Anyway, I have a reason this time.

I had written a nice long blog entry about a movie that I had been hunting down on DVD for a long time. It took me about a half hour to write. I click "post" and the browser-busy icon kept spinning. After several minutes, the server timed out and I lost all my work.

Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened. My blog software is Wordpress, which is pretty good, but it's PHP running on Windows. My hosting company hasn't quite worked out the kinks and unfortunately the server hangs from time to time. You would think I would finally get in the habit of writing posts in a separate application so as not to lose any work. Alas, no.

So when I lost that entry, I vowed to re-do my site and put it on a Linux server. The new site is going to be pretty great. It will be divided into three separate sections: Business, Personal, and Creative. The content of the current site will be moved into the "Personal" section.

To make sure that I don't take forever, I'm telling everyone that <strong>the new site will be live by August 15th</strong>! Be sure to come back on the 15th for the new site. There will still be a lot under construction, I'm sure, but at least the current site will be completely migrated.

See you back here soon!&quot;;&quot;1184160584&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;

&quot;Dream Donuts&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/food/dream-donuts&quot;;&quot;I'm always looking for an excuse to make donuts. I love donuts and I think they're highly underrated. I want to really experiment with donuts and make some fun ones.

So I'm planning a donut tasting party. I want to come up with several different recipes to try out on people. So here's what I'm thinking of:
<!--break-->
<ul>
	<li><strong>Vanilla Donuts</strong> - I'm going to use the family recipe from Grandma Fern</li>
	<li><strong>Raspberry Donuts</strong> - Same recipe as above, but using raspberry glaze</li>
	<li><strong>Pistachio Spice</strong> - One of my favorite aspects of donuts is that bread-y, cinnamon, goodness. This recipe will combine middle-eastern spices with pistachios in a cake donut.</li>
	<li><strong>Chocolate Banana Cream</strong> - I love chocolate and banana together. For this, I'll make a banana cream to inject in the center of the donut and put chocolate glaze on the outside.</li>
	<li><strong>Tangerine Filled</strong> - I wanted to do one curd-filled recipe. I keep waffling between tangerine and grapefruit. For this, I was going to use a brioche dough for the donut.</li>
	<li><strong>Strawberry Filled</strong> - Same recipe as above, but using a jam. Strawberry is the classic filling. Maybe I'll use blackberry instead since I think it's an under-rated flavor.</li>
	<li><strong>Chocolate Cake</strong> - I think I need another cake donut, and I'm missing some chocolate. Maybe I'll make it Mexican chocolate for fun.</li>
</ul>
If you have any ideas for flavors, please let me know. I'd love some ideas or feedback on the flavors.&quot;;&quot;1173103156&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Your Flight Has Been Re-routed Through Hell&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/your-flight-has-been-re-routed-through-hell&quot;;&quot;We've all heard the horror stories of people being stuck in airports for days because their flights were delayed. Somehow, it never really sunk in how bad that would be. I guess it was too far removed from my own experience.

Last week I visited my Mom and Dad in Oregon. Mom just had knee replacement surgery, so I went out to be helpful. Unfortunately, I wasn't so helpful because I had a major site launch to finish and the day before I went home, I threw my back out. I guess I had not been too careful in terms of sitting in the office chair with good posture - combined with helping Mom move things around the house. So I went to the Portland airport with a bad back, thinking I would be home soon enough and could see someone to help me fix it. Then the following chain of events happened:
<ul>
	<li>The flight was delayed by several hours leaving Portland. I had to connect in Chicago and was worried about missing my connection. They told me that all flights were on hold, so I should make my connection fine.</li>
	<li>When we got to Chicago, they put us in a holding pattern.</li>
	<li>Then they said that they couldn't land in Chicago due to weather (it didn't seem bad at all - a few scattered clouds), so they were going to take us to Indianapolis.</li>
	<li>We landed at Indianapolis and they made us sit on the tarmac for an hour.</li>
	<li>We got off the plane and stood in line for an hour to get hotel rooms. At this point, it was 1am.</li>
	<li>I got to the hotel, which I nicknamed "Hotel de Standing Water". It smelled of mold, was remote, and had some sort of weird heated indoor pool area from the 1950s. It had the air of some creepy middle-of-nowhere hotel that you see in horror films. I expected to see someone in a halloween mask holding a machete.</li>
	<li>Four hours after getting to my room, I got up, showered, and packed.</li>
	<li>Stood in line for an hour at check-in.</li>
	<li>Waited at the gate for two hours past the departure time. While this was happening, all of the scheduled flights (including one to Chicago!) left on time.</li>
	<li>Sat in the plane for another hour. They counted all the passengers 4 times. Apparently they were confused as to how many people were on the flight and couldn't get the computer to agree. At this point, I was trying to console myself that I might not get home and may have to spend another night in a hotel. I was just hoping that it would be Chicago and not Indianapolis.</li>
	<li>Got to Chicago and, of course, the flight to New York was delayed. But only by an hour!</li>
</ul>
By the time I got home, I almost felt like crying - both from relief and because my back was killing me. Thirty hours of lines, airplanes, and carrying luggage is not the best remedy for back problems. I couldn't even stand up straight.

Now when I hear reports that people have been stuck in airports for days, I can't even comprehend what that must be like. It took me about 30 hours to get from Portland, Oregon to NYC and it seemed like an eternity.

I think the lesson to be learned here is to not travel over spring break. I think that was the main problem. The weather was not so bad, but there were so many flights at full capacity that when there was a bit of a delay, all hell broke loose.&quot;;&quot;1175085359&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Yes, Virginia…There is a Spider-Man&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/comic-books/yes-virginia-there-spider-man&quot;;&quot;There's a certain part of my brain that is eight years old, is happy to be eight years old, and will always be eight years old. For instance, I am eternally grateful that I was eight years old when Star Wars came out. If I had to be born at any time, I'm glad that I was alive to be a kid when those first three Star Wars movies came out.

I have had another one of those moments. For April 30th - May 6th, New York City is having <a target="_blank" href="http://spider-manweeknyc.com">Spider-Man Week in NYC</a>. Be still my geeky heart.

My friend Sara originally told me the news. I simply replied "Every day is Spider-Man day in my head."

There are banners all over town and in the subways advertising it. Yes, it's a big corporate marketing event. But at least it's better than tried to get everyone talking about say, some new fried hamburger from McDonald's.

I've looked at the list of events and sadly I will have to steal someone's kids to participate in most of them. As an adult, I just don't think I can run through the Bronx Zoo looking for clues to Spider-Man's location. Is this why people have kids?

I'll definitely have to get a shot of the giant inflatable Spider-Man at the Sony store.

And the New York Public Library's exhibit of never-before-displayed, original Spider-Man comic books at the Humanities and Social Sciences Library sounds somewhat age appropriate.

Really, I'm just hoping to catch glimpses of people in Spider-Man costumes throughout the week.

&quot;David Reich: Spoiler Alert&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/television/david-reich-spoiler-alert&quot;;&quot;I am a late new-comer to <a target="_blank" href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index">Lost</a>. I had downloaded it for David's iPod a while back because I thought he'd like it for travel. It took me a while to getting around to watching it myself (like until I got a video iPod, for starters). I started watching the show recently and really like it so far. I watched the pilot episode on a plane. I must say - that was therapeutic. Watching a show about a plane hitting really bad turbulence and splitting in two while you're on a plane and flying in turbulence was a new one on me. At one point, I was sucked into the show and watching a moment between two characters right before the crash. Our flight was smooth as well. Then our plane hit turbulence at the exact same moment the show's plane hit turbulence. I must admit...I made an audible noise.

Anyway...

The other day I commented that I couldn't figure out which one of the cast members was Michelle Rodriguez. David said that he didn't know who that was and I explained that I remembered reading news reports that Michelle Rodriguez had been pulled over for drunk driving while in Hawaii filming Lost.

At this point, David <strong>could</strong> have put two and two together and realized that there's a major plot point that I hadn't yet seen. Instead, he blurted out "Maybe she's one of the people from the back half of the plane". At which point it became really obvious that there's a major plot twist coming up involving a bunch of people previously thought dead.

Thanks a lot, David.

I immediately chastised him for revealing something I didn't want to know about future events and this was his brilliant response: "Well...there are lots of websites with plot spoilers on the web."

Yes. And I don't visit them.

I hope that we meet these characters soon, because now this is hanging over me as I watch episodes: when are we going to meet the people from the back half of the plane?

FYI - If you haven't seen Lost and you were expecting to watch it someday, you shouldn't have been reading this blog entry.&quot;;&quot;1176321150&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;

&quot;It’s Showtime!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/dancing/it-s-showtime&quot;;&quot;<img width="300" align="right" style="margin-left: 6px" alt="c2ac.jpg" id="image114" src="http://www.marran.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/c2ac.jpg" />Last night we had our first performance of our Charleston dance routine. It's been a long 8 weeks of rehearsal and there were times when I was worried that I'd never get the choreography. Then shortly after I got the choreography, I was worried I'd never get it up to the speed of the music. I'm actually at the point now where everything seems pretty manageable, and it's a matter of everything being sharp and tight.

Technically, last night's performance was called a dress rehearsal, but there was an audience of about 30 people. I seemed to be the only with jitters, but I think some of the other troupe members were not letting on how much their nerves were affecting them.

The performance went great. The parts that I saw of it looked really hot. And the audience went wild. They started cheering about halfway through the piece and by the end, there was consistent cheering and applauding and by the time we hit our final pose, the audience went wild.

<img width="300" alt="d32f.jpg" id="image115" src="http://www.marran.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/d32f.jpg" />

Here's a shot of the final pose.My face is blocked, but I'm the one in a center with a female on my back.

We have two more performances left:
<blockquote>Thursday, Apr 26th
Frim Fram (412 8th Ave. 4th floor)
We'll perform at 11:00pm

Friday, Apr 27th
Dance Manhattan
We perform as part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dance-manhattan.com/content_show_flier.php?flier=914650fri_mar_2007guest_night.jpg&ID=349&Date=2007-04-27">Guest Night</a></blockquote>
And one final photo, we bowed as we were being showered with applause.

&quot;We’re Done?!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/dancing/we-re-done&quot;;&quot;Well, the Charleston performances have come and gone. I had a blast. It was very well received.

It's sad that I feel like I was just getting it down solidly by the last performance.

And I lost 3 pounds in the last two weeks alone with all of the rehearsal. Why don't more people dance for exercise? I get better results and have a lot more fun than any exercise machine.

&quot;Google Analytics (not really) Hacks&quot;;&quot;business/blog/analytics/google-analytics-not-really-hacks&quot;;&quot;I've been using Google Analytics for myself for quite a while. I generally put it into all the sites I build for clients.

Since it's driven by JavaScript calls, I figured that there had to be hacks so that you could report on more than just which pages were being visited. Theoretically, you could see if people were getting confused by a particular button, a form entry, anything. I did a search for "Google Analytics Hacks". I found what I was looking for, except it wasn't called a hack. The information I wanted is in the Google Analytics support section. That was easy.

The information that I was looking for is right here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=27229&topic=2978">http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=27229&topic=2978</a>.

&quot;Oscar Night&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/celebrations/oscar-night&quot;;&quot;David and I threw a small Oscar night party.

The Oscar's website had handy download-able ballots that we printed up for guests. We put together a betting pool to see who could see into the collective mind of the academy - $5 per person. I started handing out ballots and a couple of guests got so serious and driven about filling in the ballots that I wondered what I had gotten myself into. I foolishly thought this was for fun. One person entered his dog so that he could fill out two ballots.

I wanted to bake something fun, so I made an old family recipe that I have re-christened <a href="http://www.marran.com/recipes/default.aspx?recipe=E3615B36-BCD1-483C-A63E-70D8AF974500">Sea Foam Cake</a>. The crunchy gold exterior and the pristine whiteness of the cake felt very "oscarish".

At the beginning of the evening, David took a clear lead. Everyone felt a bit disappointed - what would be the fun of <em>David </em>winning? He was going to be asleep before the Oscars were over. Luckily, I caught up with David and eventually took the lead for myself. Our friend Jeff was beside himself with competitive envy. At one point, it looked like the dog's ballot was going to beat out Jeff's.

All turned out well in the end. The two truly competitive people in the room, Jeff and myself, tied for first. We could all live with that.&quot;;&quot;1172596147&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Charleston Performance Class&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/dancing/charleston-performance-class&quot;;&quot;I signed up for a Charleston Performance class taught by Evita Arce and Michael Jagger. It's eight weeks of classes. Each class is an hour and a half. There are two performance at the end of the class. Here's the flier:I had taken classes with Evita before and felt somewhat assured that I'd be able to keep up. But no matter how much you think you're prepared, it's quite intimidating to think that you'll be performing in front of strangers in 8 The decision to go ahead really came down to the fact that this is going to get me in shape better than any aerobics class and it's going to be a hell of a lot more fun.

We made a significant amount of progress in the first class. Enough for me to realize that I'm not going to flat out embarrass myself when it comes to performance time.

And the music is fun. It's two pieces: the first is "I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise" performed by Rufus Wainright. The second is "Happy Feet" performed by The Manhattan Rhythm Kings.

Since we go through material very quickly, we're expected to write down the moves after class so that we don't forget. And it's amazing how quickly all of it leaves your head. So in the interest of putting this somewhere where I won't forget, I'm writing down the sequences in my blog. This is going to be absolutely meaningless for the general public, but if there are others in the class that want to compare notes, this is a handy resource.

&quot;Real Estate Trevails&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/real-estate/real-estate-trevails&quot;;&quot;Well, good news and mixed news.

On Wednesday, I closed on a condo in Memphis Tennessee. It's a property I found through the infamous Mr. Rosenberg. He's had friends snatching up real estate in a development for the past few years, so it was my turn to get a piece. It's managed by a company that we know and trust, so there's very little to do. And since it's so cheap, I paid all cash for it. I'll get a nice little check every month for it.

I had other good news earlier this week. I saw a building in Park Slope, Brooklyn - before a listing agreement was even signed. It was on the nicest block out of the buildings that I had seen, was in the best condition, and was a 4-unit building instead of the typical 3-unit, and was rented out. The owner needed money to sell it to start building a hotel in Park Slope. It was significantly under-priced, and I jumped on it. Well, as most things that are too good to be true, it had a problem lurking under the surface. Once the lawyer started putting together the contract, we found that it was a "single room occupancy" building - not a 4 family. That's bad. It's very similar to having a rent controlled building. It's hard to get a mortgage for an SRO, and there's no guarantee that you could ever change the certificate of occupancy to a 4-family unit. If you could change it, then the sky's the limit, but it's not a gamble I'm willing to take right now. I decided that if the seller hid this from me when I saw it, that it's a sign to walk away from the deal.
So we're somewhat back to the drawing board. My broker took me to a place in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn. We're preparing to put an offer in on it. The first floor is totally renovated and the top two floors are full of students from the Pratt Institute. The rent is good and Fort Greene is a great neighborhood. The students are apparently being difficult about letting prospective buyers into the top two units. Personally, I'm very happy that they're being difficult, because it scares other buyers away and doesn't really worry me all that much.&quot;;&quot;1163853720&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;My cruelty knows no bounds...&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/my-cruelty-knows-no-bounds&quot;;&quot;I posted this photo as an experiment. Does my mother ever visit my site? My hope is that she starts hearing "nice photo" from her brothers and sisters before she finds this. It <em>is</em> a good photo of Lorenz. And just to help her out, I bumped the date up to something more recent.

Send me an email, Mom, and I'll be happy to take it down!

I have a slew of photos from our visit to Springfield that I just discovered. Here's the whole set:

[flickr-photoset:id=72157604002933956]&quot;;&quot;1210041598&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Resolute&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/comic-books/resolute&quot;;&quot;I just looked at my blog page. My last entry was November 19th? Yikes!

New Year's has passed and I have made three resolutions for the new year, along with a bunch of minor ones. The big ones are:
<ol>
	<li>Get a comic book published</li>
	<li>Get more consulting work</li>
	<li>Get my weight down to 185</li>
</ol>
And one of the minor ones is: a blog entry a day. So here I am. Part of the "blog entry a day" resolution is understanding that blog entries don't have to be major revelations - just little notes about books read, movies, seen, etc. I think I got myself into a habit that every blog entry had to be a novella. Well - no more!

So for resolution, #1, I am a few pages away from finishing the lettering on my first comic book. It's a horror story with a  title that keeps changing. The current title is "The Four Last Things". The artist did an amazing job. And I've learned a lot by doing the lettering myself. There were times when I changed the dialog to fit both the panels better or to better match the flow and characterization. So once that is done, it's time to send it to publishers. Yikes. I am dreading that.

And I have a second comic book that is being penciled now. The artist is about a third of the way through it. So that one has a ways to go yet. It's more action/comedy and I suspect I'll have an easier time getting it published.

For resolution #2, I have a couple of strong leads for more work. I should really set some goals for myself in this category so I can track progress and make changes when things aren't going according to plan.

For resolution #3, this is going to be a tough one. I've been lifting weights a lot lately which means the scale has not budged. I've been getting compliments from people about looking better, so I should pay attention to the spirit of resolution #3 and not so much the actual weight. I think a big part of that one, though, is finding more outlets for aerobic activity. I go dancing which is fun and a great way to burn calories, but it's hard to find the time to go enough. We shall see.

What are other people's resolutions for the new year?&quot;;&quot;1169045334&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Extras&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/television/extras&quot;;&quot;For those of you that have never heard of it, "Extras" is a TV show produced by HBO (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hbo.com/extras/">http://www.hbo.com/extras/</a>). It's co-written, co-directed, and starring Ricky Gervais who was the writer, creator, and star of "The Office".

I have to admit, I saw a few episodes of the original UK production of The Office and never really got into it. It had it's moments, but overall it felt to realistically sad and mundane for me. Perhaps I was just spending too much brain power getting past the accents to process the humor. I tried watching the first episode of "Extras" and found it a little funnier, but you really had to pay attention. For some reason, I kept with it. If I didn't really enjoy an episode, I'd wait a while and watch it again in a couple of weeks. It was usually funnier the second time around.

They just started the second season and the season opener was one of the best episodes of a comedy I've ever seen. Not only did it have several "bust a gut" moments, it was oddly sad and touching without being depressing.

They usually feature at least one major star in each episode playing themselves. The first season had Kate Winslet, Ben Stiller, Patrick Stewart and a bunch of UK stars that I didn't recognize. Episode 8 features David Bowie and he is amazingly funny. I had to watch the episode again the next day because I couldn't get it out of my head.

I highly recommend the show. If you don't immediately get into it, give it a few more tries. You have to actually watch it - not have it in the background while you do something else.

&quot;Wedding Photos?!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/celebrations/wedding-photos&quot;;&quot;You know how you have those things that you think "I should really do that thing" and you just never get around to it. And eventually that thing reaches some ridiculously late point of completion. And your procrastination almost becomes fascinating to watch. You begin to wonder "will I ever accomplish that task?"

Well...our wedding photos have been sitting in the library for almost 4 years now. We had a set of proofs and all the negatives. For some reason, the black and white proofs were very washed out. The photographer insisted that it was the proofs - not the negatives that were washed out. Anyway, I knew that I wanted to get digital copies of everything, so I had a task on my to-do list for years that said "wedding photos" - meaning that I should scan the proofs and post the photos. I did one page one day and realized that it was going to takes hours and hours of tedious scanning to transfer the proofs to digital copies. I tried all sorts of mantras to motivate myself: "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." Nothing worked.

I finally just took the negatives to a photo store and had them transferred to CD. It was expensive, but at least it was done. So I posted the photos to a Flickr set. You can view them here:

&quot;Visits from the Open Source Angels&quot;;&quot;business/blog/open-source/visits-open-source-angels&quot;;&quot;Some angels visited me in a dream and told me to get off my Microsoft high horse. They told me to go to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">http://www.rubyonrails.com</a>. I think I may have seen the light. I was getting really tired of the .NET framework being either ridiculously high-level with widgets that made your page look and act like a dorky .NET site or ridiculously low-level where you had to write a bunch of code for pretty standard database/middle-tier transactions. In this day and age, why should developers have to hand-write the code for moving simple form data to and from business objects and then to the database? It was all just seeming really tedious. Ruby on Rails (at first glance) does an excellent job of managing all that tedious code so you can write relatively clear, readable logic.

So after getting excited about open-source web development, that led me down the obvious path of full open source-ness: Linux, mySQL, Ruby on Rails. Or perhaps just go buy a Mac which has Ruby on Rails installed already. I started to investigate Linux about a year ago and when I got to the part of the article that said: "the hardest part is tracking down all the Linux drivers for your computer" - I ran screaming. I know that you can get Ruby on Rails and mySQL on Windows, but I did that for PHP and I get an error on my server every time I have to use it.

I was able to create a Virtual PC and installed Linux (I used Ubuntu), mySQL, and Ruby on Rails (this article was indispensable: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rubyrailways.com/getting-ruby-on-rails-up-and-running-on-ubuntu-dapper/">http://www.rubyrailways.com/getting-ruby-on-rails-up-and-running-on-ubuntu-dapper/</a>). I have yet to make a custom project with it, but it was actually not as hard to get going as I thought. I think I may make a dual boot on my machine. My install of windows is feeling really bloated and sluggish lately. If I really do switch development over to RoR, I may consider getting a Mac for my next machine. The Mac OS has RoR installed by default.

I toyed with learning PHP, but everytime I looked at it, I hated it. It really seems like it's a major step backwards in terms of good development tools, intelligent language, etc. But it turns out that most major interactive web sites are built using PHP these days.

Anyway, I was seriously considering an Apple for my next machine, when I was cured by reading this article: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008631.html">http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008631.html</a>.&quot;;&quot;1169337500&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Spammers Are Here! The Spammer Are Here!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/spam/spammers-are-here-spammer-are-here&quot;;&quot;I occasionally bemoan the fact that my website is not more popular. God knows why. Do I feel like I should be getting the attention of people that I'll never meet? I have fantasies that I'll someday get a comment from someone I don't know - something along the lines of:
<blockquote>We've never met, but I ran across your blog a few months ago and I've been reading every day since. I just want to let you know that you have one of the most interesting blogs I've ever seen.</blockquote>
The fantasy sort of goes along the lines of a typical New York fantasy, that as you pass by a production team filming a movie, that you hear the director shout "That man over there is PERFECT for our film! Someone get him a script!"

Well, I can say that I'm one step closer to my blog dream: at least the spammers have found me.

I have a plug-in on my blog called <a target="_blank" href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> which stops spammers from putting comments in your blog like links to Viagra or cheap loans. For months, not even the spammers bothered with me. But with the new year, I've all of a sudden been discovered by them. Akismet has kept them out, but it's nice to now that I'm gaining some level of popularity.&quot;;&quot;1169605479&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Gogo the Snorer&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/gogo-snorer&quot;;&quot;I never knew that dogs could snore so loudly. I'm in the kitchen watching TV. At one point, the sound got a little soft. Not silent, just soft. I heard the gentle sound of snoring. It was Gogo who was in the other room, underneath the piano, curled up asleep. I thought snoring was just for dogs with shortened snouts - like pugs or bulldogs. I'll have to go wake her up and tell he how cute she is.

&quot;Os Mutantes&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/music/os-mutantes&quot;;&quot;Last summer, we went on a canoing trip with some friends. On the ride back, my friend Jeff was listening to my favorite iPod songs and commented that I would probably enjoy a Brazilian band: <a target="_blank" href="http://osmutantes.com/">Os Mutantes</a>. Later on, he sent me an mp3 file of one of their bigger hits "A Minha Menina". It was psychedelic, pop fun, so I got their "Best of" CD, "Everything is Possible". This launched a huge Os Mutantes obsession for me. They have been my go-to band on my iPod for months now. They even helped me with my fear of flying!

I recommend skipping "Everything is Possible" and going right to the actual CDs. There are fantastic songs that didn't make it to the best-of compilation. And "Everything is Possible" has about a third of each of their first two CDs. It's more fun to go right to the source material.

Start with their first CD "Os Mutantes". You might recognize some of the songs. I had heard "Bat Macumba" before from "The Nuggets" boxed set. And "Baby" rang some far and distant bell, but I couldn't tell you for sure if I had actually heard it before or if it's just one of those songs that <em>feels </em>familiar. There's plenty more on the CD to enjoy. There were certain songs I didn't connect with at first, but then started sounding like pop icons on subsequent listenings.

Next on the list is "A Divina Comédia". This is my current favorite album of theirs. It feels like a concept album, but since I don't speak Portuguese, I can't tell you if there's any cohesion to the lyrics.  I found some sites that translated their lyrics, but they made even less sense in English. This album ends with two great songs that feel like a descent into pop madness. I was listening to this on a very turbulent flight over Spain one day. My fear of the turbulence completely disappeared. I tried listening to this song on other bumpy flights and it still works. There's something about the infectious madness of the music that puts me totally at ease.

I describe Os Mutantes to friends as The Beatles of Brazil. I don't know if that's really apt, but there is something about the psychedelic pop nature of them that feels very similar. And they certainly smoked enough pot...

&quot;Guinea Pigs: A New Comic Book&quot;;&quot;guinea-pigs-new-comic-book&quot;;&quot;Sitting on my desk, is a completely finished copy of my first comic book: Guinea Pigs. For a while, I changed the title to "The Four Last Things", but I think there's something fun and weird about "Guinea Pigs", so I'm keeping it for the time being.

It's a horror story about a group of children that were involved in an experiment at an amusement park many years ago. I won't go into a lot of detail about it here.

So it sits on my desk and I'm trying to work up the nerve to put it into a submission package to send to publishers. For some reason, this is the hard part. Actually, getting the comic book drawn, inked, colored and lettered was easy. I hired people to do the drawing and coloring. I did the lettering myself. Now I'm frozen in anticipation of sending it out. How do I package it for editors? Who should I send it out to? Should I include a box of cookies with the submission? Should I follow it up with phone calls to talk to them about it in depth? It feels like I'm just throwing a note in a bottle into the ocean in the hopes that someone stumbles across it.

Well, while I ponder these questions and tasks, I thought I'd post the first few pages of it. The color got a little washed out when I exported the images to JPG. Try to see past that. Here are the first 6 out of 22 action packed pages!

&quot;Carbonite - Cheap Online Backup&quot;;&quot;business/blog/backup/carbonite-cheap-online-backup&quot;;&quot;Once upon a time, I bought a copy of Winzip. This is before the days that zipping was built into the Windows OS. Occasionally, I get promotional email from them and I'm too lazy to unsubscribe. Well, I'm glad I haven't, because I got an email from them about a new service.

The company is called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carbonite.com/">Carbonite</a>, and they perform online backups of your system. They offer $49 a year for unlimited backup space.

I tried the service for free for 15 days. It took almost all of that time to finish backing up all the files, but now they're there. The install didn't take long. It took me a few minutes of reading instructions to figure out how to tell it what to back up. I kept looking for a dialog within the application to specify what to back up, but it's integrated with Window explorer - so you specify it by browsing files. There's a toolbar icon that tells you if it's idle or if it's actively backing up files.

I've had an external hard drive for performing backups, but that doesn't protect me if the house should burn down (knock on all wood present). I have periodically looked for an online backup solution, but could never find one that was worth the price. However, $49 per year is something I'd happily pay for the peace of mind of having files backed up.&quot;;&quot;1171926828&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Abs-solutely sore&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/exercise/abs-solutely-sore&quot;;&quot;A friend of mine has a big event coming up in April and wants to look his best. We often see each other at the gym in the morning, so we decided to work out together to keep us motivated. It's worked out great. However, I'm sore all the time these days. I think I just went a whole week of going to the gym every day. I've had different muscle groups sore every day of the week. I usually go light on a few muscle groups - like back or legs. Having someone else there makes sure that I hit everything equally hard.

And the best part of having a workout partner is having two person abs exercises. I've pulled out a few abs exercises that trainer used to have me do. I find that what I don't like about most abs exercises is that you have to push yourself to get the most out of the time. Having a two-person exercise with someone that's a little mean-spirited and competitive actually makes it easier to do abs.

So here are two exercises:
<ul>
	<li>The exerciser sits on a decline bench (knees are at the top) and sits up</li>
	<li>The trainer stands behind the person and hands the exerciser a medicine ball on the left side</li>
	<li>The exerciser, holding the medicine ball, twists and hands the medicine ball back to the trainer on the right side</li>
	<li>The trainer then hands the ball back to the exerciser on the left side</li>
	<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
This one is really good for oblique muscles.  The twisting motion combined with the medicine ball makes it a great workout. Be sure to switch sides on the  next set (right to left).

The other one is really diabolical:
<ul>
	<li>The exerciser lays down on a mat</li>
	<li>The trainer stands over the exercisers head or chest</li>
	<li>The exerciser, keeping legs totally straight throughout the exercise, raises their legs</li>
	<li>As soon as the legs are perpendicular to the floor, the trainer pushes the legs out and down forcefully</li>
	<li>The exerciser, has to stop their legs from hitting the floor, and so need to use their abs to put on the brakes</li>
	<li>As soon as the legs are up again, the trainer pushes them down</li>
	<li>Repeat until the screaming starts</li>
</ul>
It's not so much painful as it is infuriating because it's so easy for the trainer to push the legs down. I guarantee you will be sore the next day from doing these.&quot;;&quot;1172078283&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Apple: Aggressively Cool&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/music/apple-aggressively-cool&quot;;&quot;I've been seeing the new iPod commercials a lot lately. The new song is quite catchy. I thought I'd do a search and see who the band is. I'm never surprised when I don't know current bands - I stopped being impressed with popular music a long time ago. I barely ever recognize the music acts on Saturday Night Live anymore.

Anyway, the band playing in the iPod commercials is "The Fratellis". And get this - their albums aren't even released in the U.S. yet! There's an EP of some of their songs that you can get on iTunes, but if you want the full CD, you have to wait until March. It's a band from Scotland and they've apparently hit it big out there. According to a reviewer on Amazon, all of their songs are ridiculously catchy. I pre-ordered the CD on Amazon.
How aggressively cool is Apple to select a song for their new iPod commercials using a CD that isn't even released in the U.S. yet? It's almost frightening.&quot;;&quot;1172328019&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Seder at the Adelson / Kloepfer House&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/friends/seder-adelson-kloepfer-house&quot;;&quot;My photography class got me out of the first night of passover. I made a stunning pistachio macaroon cake for David to take with him (more on that recipe another time). 

So, to be a good goyishe husband, I agreed to go to the second night of passover at our friends' Sara Adelson and Curtis Kloepfer. They have two sons, Jonathan and Joshua. I decided to bring along my new camera. I think I got some good shots in. 

I was sitting next to Jonathan. He asked to see the photos and noticed that I had taken a lot of his brother and not many of him. I told him that it's easier to get a shot of Joshua because he sits still. It worked like a charm.

Eventually, the Wii won out and the kids ended up playing Lego Star Wars instead of finishing the seder.

&quot;Reap What Your Sow&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/garden/reap-what-your-sow&quot;;&quot;As many of you may know, I keep an herb garden in our backyard. Most of the time, I let the plants do what plants do and just try to make sure they're watered enough. Last year, I lost a few plants with my cavalier attitude to gardening. And my tomato production seemed a little low. This year, I decided to do it right. I bought several seeds, got a seed starting kit, and started growing seeds on the top floor.
<!--break-->

As you can see, they're all growing! This is the first wave. It includes, a lot of basil, tomatoes, peppers, thyme, mint, and parseley. I also have seeds for tomatillos, cilantro, and pumpkin, but they either start later or go directly in the ground. I actually read the instructions on the seed package. Amazing what a difference that made!&quot;;&quot;1143132047&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;A Passage to India&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/dreams/passage-india&quot;;&quot;I've been having a lot of dreams over the past several months that involve traveling to India. Last night, I had my most vivid dream yet about traveling there. It was broken up into three major sections. Each section was in full color and crystal clear accuracy. I even remember the feeling of touch at some parts of the dream.
The first section centered around buying property in India, although the location was a cross between Mexico and India. I was with Sara and another woman that I did not recognize. She knew Sara, but was more of a local guide. She was going to take us to a building that I was thinking about buying. We walked through a jungle to get there. The guide told us that there were some people that were bitten by the animals in the jungle and died. I suggested that we hurry up and get out of the jungle because it sounded dangerous and I could see the little animals scurrying around our path. Sara stopped to say that she wasn't worried and as she was talking, some thick tree vines came down over her head and started to wrap around her hair, pulling up. I reached over and grabbed the vines (I remember actually touching them) and entwined her hair. She then agreed that it was time to get out of the jungle. We went to go meet the people at the building that I was thinking about buying. They weren't much interested in me and held some resentment because they liked the previous landlord. I wished them well, understood that over time they would appreciate me, and let them be.

The next phase of the dream was clearly in India. I was with my family and we were wandering around. Sis had the guidebook and suggested we go to a park nearby that was somewhat secluded and had a meditation retreat in it. We found the retreat. It was beautiful green park with a terraced landscape. Scattered on the tiers were various people meditating, some were Buddhist monks and some were westerners. At the bottom of the park was a rectangular, stone pool of water about 10 feet deep. Also on the terraces were small clay pots with incense or with red powder. I saw and meditated. Someone in my family got lost and disoriented (it was getting dark and there was a lot of incense smoke and mist from the pool) and wandered into the pool creating a large splash. I came out of the meditation, helped the family member out of the pool and we left.

The next phase of the dream was with David. I believe that we were leaving where we were to go someplace interesting. We got in a car with a driver that we did not know who was going to take us to this place. We started driving through the jungle on a very bumpy and winding path. At some point, I started getting disoriented. It seemed as if the driver was driving without his lights on, but when I looked closely there was a light that we were heading towards. It felt as if we might be traveling through a tunnel of some sort. I was getting worried, but I trusted the driver and decided to relax and let him take us where we needed to go. He took us to his home first, to meet his family, before we went the rest of the way. We was a foreigner that had relocated from a western country. For some reason, David and I thought he was Dutch. He had a small daughter that we met and then his wife. The dream ended shortly after that.&quot;;&quot;1143220623&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Private: Post #17&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/dreams/private-post-17&quot;;&quot;Two sets of dreams last night, all around the theme of terrorism. The first dream was set in a high school type setting. Someone was going to blow up a school or office. I vaguely remember thinking that they were trying to get Jason from D&P to set off the bomb, and I felt better knowing that he wouldn't give in to demands. However, they tortured him and he gave in. For some reason it was going to be up to me to set off the bomb. I think Jason was coming after me to force it to go off. I felt better knowing that I was in control and that there was nothing that Jason could do to force me to set off the bomb.

The second dream was a bit more military. At one point, I was in a video game like setting and trying to figure out how to defeat this tought guy in hand-to-hand combat. I had a small cell phone device that could throw blows or spells at him. I think he morphed into my teacher at one point and the dream finished with me being a disciple of his. Me and several others were going to be in some sort of performance, but everyone was concerned that we were going to be attacked by terrorists. Once again, it was going to be up to me to diffuse the situation and I was confident that I would take care of it.&quot;;&quot;1143547019&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;You know it’s spring when…&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/celebrities/you-know-it-s-spring-when&quot;;&quot;I'm seeing the real signs of spring in New York. It's not tulips on the sidewalks. It's not birds chirping in the air (although we have some really vocal ones in our backyard this year). It's movie crews. I always forget every year how much filming goes on in New York in the spring and summer. I've perfected my look of disdain when some overly pierced intern with a clipboard asks me if I could please walk on the other side of the street so as not to disrupt the shot.

I never see the actual stars, either. I tend to think a lot of the filming is for commercials or music videos. Either that, or the celebrities hide in their mobile home and only come out for the 10 seconds that they're needed.

On a side note, I saw Sarah Jessica Parker on the street the other day. She blended in with New York quite well. Many celebrities try so hard to not be noticed that they call attention to themselves. She seemed nonchalant. Didn't wear a hat.&quot;;&quot;1143658199&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Private: Back to School&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/dreams/private-back-school&quot;;&quot;I had a dream last night that I had to go back to Knox because I never technically finished my last year. God I hate those dreams. I've had them frequently the past year or so. Last night, I remember attending some sort of farewell dinner with everyone in New York. I usually spend the dream thinking if I'm going to audition for a theater production again or if I'm  going to do my own thing.

I think in some ways, the dream reflects how uncomfortable I was to go back to Knox a year after everyone else had graduated. It also brings up issues of feeling like things are out of my control - that there is some mistake in my past that I have yet to resolve. I spend most of the dream thinking about how I'm going to survive without David, Oz, and Gogo and all my friends.&quot;;&quot;1144006223&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Road to Nirvana&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/buddhism/road-nirvana&quot;;&quot;Those of you in the know have heard that I've been shopping religions. I think it all goes back to when I read <a target="_blank" title="Life of Pi" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156027321/sr=8-1/qid=1145359454/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-1107627-0351221?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Life of Pi</a> by Yann Martel. The first quarter of the book talks about the main character as a boy in India getting equally excited about Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. I realized that I don't know that much about religions outside of Christianity and Judaism. I tried a few "Introducing..." books to get to know some of the basics of Islam and Hinduism. Although <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1840463635/qid=1145359669/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-1107627-0351221?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Introducing Islam</a> was good, I was still totally lost after reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184046626X/qid=1145359709/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-1107627-0351221?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Introducing Hinudism</a>. I bought a Qur'an to read, but the real thing proved extremely dry and dense - sort of like reading the Bible!

Then I saw <a target="_blank" href="http://www.surya.org/">Lama Surya Das</a> on The Colbert Report and thought that I should give Buddhism another try. I had dismissed Buddhism because I read some Buddhist books by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/vctr/">Chögyam Trungpa</a> and decided that it was just too intense - thoughts like "life is emptiness" and "reaching Nirvana through boredom" turned me off for some reason. I gave Buddhism another try and had a similar experience for different reasons. This time, I read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767901576/sr=8-1/qid=1145360017/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-1107627-0351221?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Awakening the Buddha Within : Tibetan Wisdom for the Western World</a> by Lama Surya Das. At first, I was really connecting to the book and finding it incredibly transformative. Eventually, I started getting really down on myself. I started seeing just how far I have to go to resemble anything Buddha-like. I hit a chapter that was talking about not talking about other people when they aren't present - even if it's good! That whole week I noticed just how gossipy I was and not particularly interested in changing. Subsequently, everything I read started feeling like an unattainable goal and more excuses to beat myself up.

I met with a former co-worker, Uma Natarajan, who said that many people (herself being one) consider that there are only three major religious texts in the world: The Bible, The Qur'an, and The Bhagavad Gita (Hinduism). I believe she was making the point that Buddha was raised a Hindu and reached enlightenment in India, so he's really a subset of Hinduism. (I suppose this is the same thinking that middle-eastern terrorists employ when they lump Christianity and Judaism as essentially the same thing. When Uma reads this, I'm sure she'll chastise me for missing the point of what she was saying.) Anyway, I took her larger concept of the Bhagavad Gita as a major religious text, so I put Buddha on hold and started reading it. It's fantastic, but you can only read it a page at a time. It's incredibly dense - like a religious version of desne chocolate cake. You have to savor each bite before you can move on to the next piece.

And somewhere in all this, I went back to reading the Lama Surya Das book. I noticed that my life had changed since reading it and that I shouldn't feel discouraged from feeling so far away from Buddha. For one, I had started being far more communicative, complimentary, and optimistic with other people (not a small feat living in New York City!). I never noticed that I didn't ever look people in the eye before. Now, I say hello, smile, and ask them how their day is - with sincerity. It's incredible to see people in New York perk up just a little bit. The barrier of "Us vs. Them" that most New Yorkers walk around in dissolves. I've become far more tolerant of other people. A lot of my judgement has washed away. My thoughts directed towards myself have been much more encouraging instead of just rants or internal criticisms.

So I guess I'm on a dual path right now - read a little Bhagavad Gita, read a little Lama Surya Das. The real test, I think, will come when looking for a community or sacred place to visit.&quot;;&quot;1145357361&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Private: Notes for issue #1 revision&quot;;&quot;creative/private-notes-issue-1-revision&quot;;&quot;The goal is to make this sell-able or pitch-able. Therefore, ew need to stop stepping around the edges of things. Don't let things unfold slowly, bang it into place. The goal of any good horror movie is to show that the interactions of the characters is the true horror.
<ul>
	<li>Rename it "The Guinea Pigs"</li>
	<li>Start and end it with Dr. Lamont watching outside of the NYU building. We have to know that this is a controlled experiment from the very beginning.</li>
	<li>Possibly show the drug deal to Peter's friend at some point. Perhaps at the beginning, perhaps at the very end.</li>
	<li>When Joe tries to warn Amy that a monster is in the building, they try to escape out the window. Dr. Lamont sees the unfortunate result of that from the outside.</li>
	<li>Forget Officer Bradley as a major character. He's gone after the first episode.</li>
	<li>Let Dr. Lamont explain what went on with the experiments. Let him spill all the beans.</li>
</ul>
So that leaves the second issue as a little dry. We see more of Dr. Lamont with Audrey. There has to be a watcher. Perhaps Peter sees the watcher from the balcony. The issue ends with the watcher telling Dr. Lamont that the second one has been a success.&quot;;&quot;1145557455&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Gogo’s 2nd Surgery&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/gogo-s-2nd-surgery&quot;;&quot;For those that don't know, Gogo has floating patellas - which means that her knee caps don't stay where they should. We had one of the knees fixed last September. The recovery was pretty bad (she just laid there and cried the saddest sound in the world for the first two days), but she moved much better afterwards. Well, the other knee started showing signs of problems and her movement started to go down again, so we scheduled to have the other knee done. I took a picture of her inncoently sleeping this morning, unaware that she was scheudled to go in for surgery.

[flickr-photo:id=2298710259]

She woke up soon after the camera flash started going off and was a little ticked off about it.

[flickr-photo:id=2298711049]

She didn't seem too bothered once we got her leash and took her out. And even at the Animal Hospital, she wasn't freaking out like I thought she would be. She did poop as soon as we walked into the hospital, but that was more my fault for not giving her enough time out on the street.

So now I'm at home and Oz and I are whimpering until Gogo gets home. I think Oz is more traumatized than I am by the absence of Gogo. I keep trying to focus on the fact that this will be over soon and she'll be able to run and play more without pain. It's hard to see the forest for the trees right now, though.&quot;;&quot;1146145463&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Private: Being Accepted and Loved&quot;;&quot;creative/private-being-accepted-and-loved&quot;;&quot;I was reading a review of "Bulgarian Lovers" and the reviewer pointed out that pretty much every gay movie has the same basic theme of "wanting to be accepted". I think I would extend that to "accepted and loved". So I thought about writing an anti-play around that theme. How do you push that so that it doesn't make sense anymore? Maybe not everyone should be accepted and loved? Maybe we should have some sort of discerning tastes?

And then it occured to me that that is what I'm really trying to write with The Cock Cage. You can't accept everything. You can maybe love everything. And when you through yourself into a situation of accepting everything, perhaps you throw yourself in too deep.

On a separate note...

Yesterday, I was attending a reading of "An Uncertain Hour" and started brainstorming allusions. San Francisco, the city by the bay, drenched in fog. Where are its literary parallels? I thought perhaps The Old Man and the Sea or Moby Dick. God, I'd hate to have to read Moby Dick. Perhaps a better analogy is The Flying Dutchman. Yes, the leather master is from Amsterdam. He's the one looking for his mate.
<blockquote>According to <a title="Folklore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore">folklore</a>, the <strong>Flying Dutchman</strong> is a <a title="Ghost ship" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_ship">ghost ship</a> that can never go home, but must sail 'the seven seas' forever.</blockquote>

This goes along with my notion that San Francisco is not home.

<blockquote><strong>Bernard Fokke</strong> was a <a title="17th century" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_century">17th century</a> Dutch <a title="Captain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain">captain</a> for the <a title="Dutch East India Company" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company">Dutch East India Company</a>.

This caused speculation that he was in fact in league with the <a title="Devil" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil">devil</a> because of it.

This also caused many people to believe that he was the captain of the <a title="Flying Dutchman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Dutchman">Flying Dutchman</a>, a ghostly ship doomed to sail the seas forever.</blockquote>

When we came into the waiting area of the animal hospital, she was wearing a cone, had her complete lower right side shaved, and was hobbling on three legs desperate to get out of the hospital. She got a universal "awwww..." from the waiting area.

The first day, there were times that she had a wide eyed terror look in her face that I assume was the last of the drugs wearing off. There were times when she would simply whine about nothing in particular. The first night of sleep was fitfull and we had to get up every few hours. I think she was mainly feeling pain and the effects of the opiates. Despite all of that, she was much much better this time around for the surgery. She was able to go to the bathroom outside without any help. Last time, she stumbled and fell over and couldn't figure out how to move. She drank water right away this time and she has the typically abundant Gogo appetite.

Still, I completed underestimated how much work it was to care for her in recovery. Although Oz has been very respectful of her state and never leaves her alone, he still wants his walks. And I underestimated how hard it would be to leave Gogo alone. I called Rodrigo, our dog walker and general helper, and asked if he had any time to walk Oz over the weekend. He helped out tremendously.

The second night of sleep went much better and Gogo didn't make much of a fuss at all. In fact I think I woke up before any of the dogs which is a <em>rarity </em>- believe me!

I did leave them alone for a few hours on Sunday afternoon. Gogo didn't seem too bothered by wearing the cone. Rodrigo said that she was asleep when he showed up.

This morning I noticed that Gogo's "hospital grittiness" had disappeared. When I picked her up, she had a lot of dandruff where she still had hair and just seemed to feel sort of gritty. This morning her coat is feeling strong and smooth again. I assume it's a combination of being allowed to sleep in the sun and getting her omega oil supplements.

I think the big challenge on this recovery will not be helping her through the pain and disorientation, but trying to slow down her recovery. Now that she's more awake and aware, I can see her little devious mind trying to figure out how to get the staples out, how to lick wounds without getting caught, how to jump up on the furniture, etc.&quot;;&quot;1146484036&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;One of the Joys of Adulthood&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/piano/one-joys-adulthood&quot;;&quot;I've been taking piano lessons this year. It's one of the skills I always wished I had. Also, I used to plink around on the piano all through high school and college writing music. I miss it, but this time I'm going to learn to play correctly in the hopes that I can write something more than just chords and a melody.

Anyway, I have run across one of the great joys of adulthood. When I was a kid, I always felt bad about not practicing enough (well, not bad enough to actually practice). As I got older, I got to see that the kids that practiced a lot were significantly better musicians, so I practiced maybe a little more than when I first started - but still not really "enough". Now that I'm an adult, I realize that I don't have to feel bad when I don't practice! It's my responsibility! No teacher is going to give me a bad grade, no parent is going to scowl, my instructor doesn't even really get that upset (I think because he has other clients that almost never practice). What's the result of my not practicing? I'm not as good at doing the thing that I chose to do.

Most of the time, I practice every day and enjoy it. However, there are times when I don't practice because I've been too busy or travelling. I relish the freedom I feel at knowing that there's no one around to admonish me. It's one of the times that I can suddenly appreciate being a responsible adult. And sure enough, I get back to practicing when my schedule frees up.&quot;;&quot;1146575836&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;A Blessing from Martha Stewart&quot;;&quot;creative/blog/betsy-stevens/blessing-martha-stewart&quot;;&quot;Last night, David and I went to the Mount Sinai Crystal Ball. It's the hospital's annual really big fundraiser. I have to admit that I don't usual look forward to going. I had been to two already, and they are usually kind of fun but largely dull. It's very dependent on who you sit next to.

This year's I was having a slightly better than usual year. I saw next to my David and David Nudo. We were having a good time and I remained entertained while David went to press the flesh. During dinner, David was sitting next to me, so we got some visits from his colleagues - one of whom is the vice president in charge of public relations. She mentioned that Martha Stewart was there and David suggested we go meet her. So before I could say anything, we got up to visit Martha's table.

I sort of imagined that we would get within viewing distance and say "Yep. That's her. Cool." I also thought that if we got introduced, she would say hello and go back to hanging out with her group. What I did not expect was a full introduction and a few minutes of discussion. When we were introduced, she smiled, stood up from the table, and started talking to us. She asked me what I did and I told her that I was an aspiring comic book writer and told her that she is the inspiration for a comic book that I'm working on. David added, "Don't worry. It's tasteful." And laughingly she replied with "It doesn't bother me if it is or if it isn't."

We chatted for a few minutes. She was extremely cordial and personable. And she looked very good for her age. Someone should get the number of her plastic surgeon.

There was a bit of star-struck in my eyes. A big part of me hopes that this is a good omen in terms of my comic book. I thought of the people that would hold out screenplays or novels for the Pope to touch in hopes of getting a blessing. So let's hope that some of that Martha Stewart magic rubs off into Betsy Stevens and the Domestic Godesses.&quot;;&quot;1146852462&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Dog Whisperer&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/dog-whisperer&quot;;&quot;I hate to admit it, but after South Park did an episode featuring "The Dog Whisperer", I dediced to watch the show. I've been hooked ever since. For those of you that haven't heard of the show, it's on the National Geographic Channel. You can also go to Cesar Millan's website: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dogpsychologycenter.com/">http://www.dogpsychologycenter.com/</a>.

I started using his tactics at home on Oz and Gogo. I have to admit, they've worked very well. When they decided that they didn't want to behave, I used to give them a very loud and aggressive "HEY" to get them to pay attention. It worked, but I really didn't like looking that out of control on the street. So I switched to Cesar's "PSST" which I don't have to do as loudly for them to react to. And I taught them that by doing a gentle but quick hand-claw on the their throat while I made the sound. The first time I did it to Gogo, she threw her ears back in shock and stared at me in disbelief. I only had to do it twice with her. She now knows that "PSST" means business. Gogo no longer waits forever on our front steps before coming down for a walk. Whenever she stubbornly pulls towards a doggie store, I give her a "PSST" and she gives up. Oz has been a little slower about picking up a reaction to "PSST", but it still works wonders. He's much better on walks.

I've also been able to significantly cut down on their dog aggression on walks. For a while, it was getting pretty bad. I was crossing the street whenever I saw a nother dog coming because i knew they were going to lunge and snarl at another dog. I changed my behavior so that if another dog is coming up to us, I put both Gogo and Oz behind me and make sure I stay in between them and the strange dog. Their aggression is almost none existent when I do that. I've now let them say hello to other dogs and I carefully watch Gogo (since she's usually the instigator of dog aggression). If Gogo starts to growl at the new dog, I give her a "PSST" and move her behind me. It's worked wonders.

I just read the following link: <a target="_blank" title="http://www.newsday.com/features/printedition/ny-etlede4743494may17,0,1617948.story?coll=ny-features-print" href="http://www.newsday.com/features/printedition/ny-etlede4743494may17,0,1617948.story?coll=ny-features-print">http://www.newsday.com/features/printedition/ny-etlede4743494may17,0,1617948.story?coll=ny-features-print</a>. I guess it's not surprising that everyone wants to sue Cesar Millan or talk about how he's "set dog training back to the middle ages". There are too many people in this world that only know how to take aim at other people rather than create success for themselves. Positive reinforcement works for training tricks, but there are some behavior elements that just cannot be addressed with positive reinforcement. We've given Gogo a lot of positive reinforcement, and she often uses it to walk all over us.

It's also a shame that people have reduced Cesar Millan's tactics to "being abusive to your dog to get it to pay attention". There's nothing in his show about being cruel or physically abusive. When I went to do the "hand-claw on the neck" with Oz and Gogo, I barely applied pressure. They understood what I was doing without me having to be physically harmful.

Well, thank God the South Park guys gave Cesar some room in the spotlight to Cesar.&quot;;&quot;1148073918&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;McKee Transformations&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/writing/mckee-transformations&quot;;&quot;I recently took a seminar with screenwriting professor extraordinaire, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mckeestory.com/homepage.htm">Robert McKee</a>. The seminar was a weekend long about four different film genres: Horror, Thriller, Comedy, and Masterpiece. I signed up for two days: Horror and Comedy. The horror day was for a comic book script that I had written that always got a somewhat lackluster response and the comic day was for a play that I'm about to start work on.

I'm not going to go into a huge amount of detail about the class and McKee as a teacher other than to say that it has really transformed how I think about writing dramatic material. I went back and re-read his book, Story.  I have since changed how I go about writing.

At first, I thought I could get away with a few edits to my horror comic book, but leave most of the whole thing in place. However, as I started to notice scenes that didn't work and have an understanding of why they didn't work, I realized that I had to start over with an outline. Then, as I went through the outline, I realized that my problem ran deeper than just the outline, it was the scene structure. Then as I started to write out more detailed scene information, I realized that I needed to start over with the characters. In the end, I gutted everything and started over. I created a Word document along the lines of McKee's "things to watch out for" as I put together the scenes.

I created some character maps in Microsoft Visio to show who the characters are, what their dimensions are, and how they play against each other. (However, I re-read McKee's section of characters this morning and realized that I need to revisit the character map to make it clearer.) Then I went through each scene in the story of the first issue. For each scene, I had the following information:
<ul>
	<li>Who is the protagonist of the scene? What do they want in this scene?</li>
	<li>Who or what is the antagonist? What's stopping the protagonist?</li>
	<li>What is the subtext of the scene? In other words, what are the characters trying to communicate to each other without actually saying it? For instance "I'm smarter than you" or "I don't feel safe around you".</li>
	<li>What's the progression of values in the scene? Does the protagonist get closer to their goal or farther away?</li>
</ul>
There were often modifications to characters as I went through this, because I would discover a character that had no real motivation. I had left them completely static and therefore uninteresting. Either that or their motivations were so generic as to be a non-entity. Once I gave them real motivations, they started becoming real people.

I also noticed as I was putting together progression of values that sometimes the scene didn't move forward at all. I would think that I had a nice scene, would get to the progression of values and notice that nothing changed. The protagonist of the scene didn't get any closer or further away from their goal. All of a sudden, I would mentally snap out of my writer's mind and approach it from the mind of a generic reader and I would see the scene as dull. This usually meant that I would go back and modify the character a bit throughout the story so that the scene in questions <em>could </em>be interesting; or it meant that the scene got cut as unnecessary.

I found huge scenes that were dull and lifeless as pure exposition that could <em>easily </em>be made dramatic. Since I had a solid character map that told me what made the character tick, I could easily add a force to an expository scene to make that scene dramatic.

Most of the changes were very subtle but will hopefully add to a much more compelling issue. I have not written any dialogue yet, but I can already see that the dialog will largely write itself. If I'm particularly uninspired, I have enough notes in the scene breakdowns that I can write the dialogue without any need for creativity (that sounds bad, but it's true!).

I should also point out that this was <em>excruciating </em>at first. I hope that this gets easier over time. I've been spending the past week looking at other things that I do well, and there is always this "outlining" approach. Especially when writing code, I often write all of the function calls first, so that the structure of the code is in place before I write the working code.&quot;;&quot;1148649807&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;McKee Transformations, pt. 2&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/writing/mckee-transformations-pt-2&quot;;&quot;Okay. So I had the McKee seminar, re-read his book, and found myself full of great ideas, renewed spirit, and totally unable to write.

I was completely weighed down by all these various thoughts that my writing was coming out forced and awkward. I talked to my coach, Kevin Creedon, about it and we went back to the drawing board about writing.

First of all, I was going to try not writing from beginning to end. Instead, I was going to work more or less backwards, or at least write the passages that I "knew" in my gut first and then would flesh out from there. (I used to write like that all the time and somehow got in the habit of writing start ot finish when I took a comic book class).

Secondly, I was going to write scenes/character actions on index cards and arrange them in a way that helped communicate the story to me. (I had been doing this on the computer, but there's something about printing something out and re-arranging it that is much more clear than typing it into an outline on screen.) I went to Staples and got a package of Avery business cards (since there are more per page) and types up very brief character actions on the cards. I spread all the cards on the kitchen table and starting re-arranging things. I realized that I had left out some important elements. And it really helped to see how each character action had to lead into the next.

The third task, which I have yet to do, is break the witing into a series of "passes". There will be NO EDITING on the first round. Whatever is typed stays there. Then I will come up with a series of editing passes. For instance, perhaps the first pass, I will focus on more robust panel descriptions. Perhaps the second pass will focus on communicating subtext. I'll come up with a series of passes and then I will change the order of passes as I work through each page of the script. The point is to experiment to find the correct order of editing passes that works best for me.

I'm about 1/3 of the way through the first draft of the new script, and already I feel things going much better. The "bones" of the script feels like it's in place. I can see the flow of character and action in a way that wasn't there before, and I'm focusing on the essentials of the script and not getting side-tracked with clever, but unnecessary nuances.

The thing that was kind of bugging me was the fact that I didn't have any room to spread out my business cards of character actions. So I went back to Staples and got cork wall tiles. I've attached them to the back of my office door.

<img alt="Keith Marran's Revised Office" id="image31" src="http://www.marran.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/PICT0001.jpg" />

On the right side of the door, you can see the little business cards that map out the story for issue one. You will also see a color drawing on the left side of the door. That's a little technique Kevin taught me for keeping motivated on another script. Each time I work on it, I add another line to the "puzzle". My brain gets a little adrenaline rush at completing the puzzle and ensures that I keep working on the script to finish the puzzle.

This photo makes it look like the cork job wasn't very good. Damn this expensive camera! In reality, the tiles look very even.

So, my home office is really taking shape. It's like a little creative coccoon.&quot;;&quot;1149470468&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The New Piano Teacher&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/piano/new-piano-teacher&quot;;&quot;One of my New Year's resolutions this year was to learn piano. I started with someone that I had found on craiglist. It started off well. However, I felt like I outgrew him rather quickly. All of the pieces that he picked were frenetic finger exercises and I often grew bored of the pieces. One of the first pieces that he had given me was a Back minuet. I liked the piece, and got the fingering down realtively quickly. However, the more I practiced it, the less like music it sounded. It kept sounding more and more plodding, forced, and "scale-like". I asked him a couple times and he always said that it sounded uneven and would make me practice with the metronome more.

In general, the lessons were extremely critical. I would play a measure or two and he would provide constant on-going criticism like "3rd finger on the D", "that wasn't staccato enough", "you didn't hold that note long enough", etc. No surprise - I eventually started to dread piano lessons. David has noticed an improvement in my playing, but I felt more like I was learning fingering exercises rather than learnign to play piano. I picked up some music from books that we had in the house and the thought of playing something other than what he was teaching was daunting to say the least. He wrote out all of my fingering, so how was I supposed to figure out which fingers to use?

There was one day in particular that he was hyper critical. I had arrived already quite proud of the progress I had made on a piece. Considering that I couldn't play any of it the week before and I had put it together in a week's time, I was excited to show off. He started in with the constant criticism and I started playing worse and worse. I felt terrible by the end of the lesson. I decided to give him a couple more weeks and see if that was just a fluke week for him. Really, though, after that lessons my heart just wasn't in it anymore.

I had been talking with a former co-worker, Joy Ellen Snellgrove, about piano teachers. I told her stories about my current teacher and she suggested that I contact her former teacher (she had moved to Boston) Robert Cowie (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.robertcowie.com/">http://www.robertcowie.com/</a>). She told me a bit about the technique that he uses, but it didn't really sink in until our first lesson. She described the approach as thus: You're learning a new piece. Most people teach that you should slow a piece down to a point that you can play it and then try to bring it up to speed. The problem with that is that you don't really understand the piece at the point in which you learn to play the notes. You really only learn "technical proficiency", but you don't really understand the piece much because you're playing a much slower version - and usually ignoring the musicality of the piece. Instead, start by just playing the down-beat notes. When you can do that, add in the notes at the quarter beat, etc.

So, I ran this around in my head and went to my first lesson. First of all, I have since realized how much bad programming I had been under from my old teacher. I was constantly saying "sorry" as I would mess up notes. I was hitting the keys very hard (he insisted that if you play a new piece forcefully, it will get in your muscle memory better). And overall, I was just very down on myself about my piano playing.

The new teacher has been trying to break that down. I've had several lectures about not being so hard on myself about my playing. Some general statements have been: "There are people dying in Iraq. They are suffering. You are not." At one point, I could not get my fingers to do something I wanted them to do. I was getting extremely frustrated and he actually burst out laughing at me.

Then, there's the teaching technique. We started with the Bach minuet that I said never sounded like music to me. We started off playing just the down-beat notes. Mentally, I was trying to play all the music in my head and just press the keys on the downbeats. He said it doesn't work that way. I had to play the notes as if they were the only notes written. With some repetition, I could hear what those notes were doing and it started sounding like music. Then we added just the quarter beat notes in the right hand. Once again, I had to start hearing the notes lead from one to the next. (I'm making this sound easy, but if you've never looked at a full page of music and tried to isolate out just a few notes, it's quite hard.) Eventually, I started adding in more of the notes. At each point, I played as if it was a completed piece.

At the end of the first week, David heard me practicing and said that it was the first time my practicing sounded like music rather than fingering exercises.

Now that I've had the introduction, he's started throwing more variations. Some of them are:
<ul>
	<li>Playing the bass clef in both the right and left hand</li>
	<li>Playing the treble clef in both the right and left hand</li>
	<li>Playing the bass clef with the right hand and the treble clef with the left hand</li>
	<li>Clumbing notes together as chord instead of runs of notes</li>
	<li>Playing everything a half-step up</li>
	<li>Playing only one hand a half-step up</li>
</ul>
They are all very bizarre exercises. I never really understand what's going on when I do the exercises, but when I go back and play the piece normally, it's like a brand new piece. The music comes pouring out. I've never experienced anything like it.

That's all well and good for a piece that I already knew, but I really wanted to see how it would work with a piece I didn't know. I went to a music store and got a book of Harold Arlen songs and picked out a piece that didn't look to demanding: "This Time the Dream's On Me". It's very slow going, but the piece is coming together. We started off just playing down-beats. Even though you're playing a small fraction of the song, you still hear the progression of music. Then I added in quarter-note beats, etc. I can play just the melody and bass clef right now and if you didn't know that I was omitting the harmonies, you would think I was playing the whole thing. It's pretty amazing after just two lessons.

So the piano has really come to life for me. I no longer have the feeling that it will be at least 4 years of arduous torture before I'll be able to enjoy playing piano.&quot;;&quot;1149526557&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Piano is Blowing My Mind&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/piano/piano-blowing-my-mind&quot;;&quot;Just had lesson #3 from Robert Cowie yesterday. The lesson hit me as particularly profound. We did a lot of the same types of exercises that we had done before, playing clumps of notes together, transposing up a half step, outlining phrases. But this week the general theme of the lesson was playing with your ear, not your mind.

I suppose a lot of my attitude towards the piano comes from being raised with a wind instrument. Especially with a trombone, you spend most of your mental energy listening to what you're playing in relationship with everyone else. So much so, that I found it extremely frustrating to play the trombone. (Plus, I never got the hang of the "PPHHHTT" thing of playing a brass instrument.) Saxophone was a bit easier, but still, you could bend notes with your mouth, so you had to be aware of what you were playing in relation to everyone else to stay in tune. With a piano, there's no question as to whether you're in tune or not. And if you are out of tune, you can't fix it as you play.

I always thought that I had to "calculate" where my fingers were supposed to go. Many of the exercises that we did focused on playing with your ear rather than with your mind. THe big shift in my head would come would I stop trying to calculate wher my fingers were supposed to go on what beat and just play with my ears - trust that my musical brain was going to put the fingers where they were suppsoed to go and if they didn't, let themselves correct. It's a very bizarre experience because I feel as if I'm letting a part of my head do the work that I'm not consciously aware of.

The other big lesson that he gave is that the goal is to play the whole piece free and easy. Therefore, I have to learn the piece free and easy. I can't practice the piece tense, frustrated, and calculating and expect that at some later point I'll be able to drop the tension, frustration and calculation. So the process is to break the learning of the piece into segments that always feel free and easy. To always practice in the mannerin which I want to be able to play it someday.

Ah-hah. A lot to process. It's been just over 24 hours since the lessons and there's been a dramatic improvment in my playing and my enjoyment of my playing. THe Bach minuet that has been haunting me is like a whole new piece. I t completely opened up to me this afternoon.&quot;;&quot;1149798312&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Private: Writing Tests&quot;;&quot;creative/private-writing-tests&quot;;&quot;I'm working on an exercise to better understand the various editorial passes one takes on a script. Let's put them down in two categories:
<ul>
	<li>Preparing for myself</li>
	<li>Preparing for distribution</li>
</ul>
I can easily identify elements of the second one:
<ul>
	<li>Finalize page and panel breakdowns</li>
	<li>Expand character descriptions and panel descriptions</li>
</ul>
The first one's a little harder. It's based on good content.
<ul>
	<li>Subtext - are characters clearly communicating subtext?</li>
	<li>Desperation - are characters truly going for what they want?</li>
	<li>Parallels - do lines have matching parallels?</li>
	<li>Transitions - does each scene transition smoothly</li>

&quot;The Cruelest Daddy in the World&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/cruelest-daddy-world&quot;;&quot;It's been about 8 weeks now since Gogo had surgery for her floating patella. About three times over the course of her recovery, someone suggested I consider getting hydrotherapy for her. We live just 5 blocks from a canine hydrotherapy place in the city (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedogrun-nyc.com/">http://www.thedogrun-nyc.com/</a>), so I took it as a sign from God that Gogo should have hydrotherapy.

I had been resisting because I know how much Gogo hates water. She doesn't like going out in the rain, she doesn't like going out when it's still from having rained recently, she doesn't like walking on a sidewalk that's been recently hosed down. I couldn't imagine anything crueler than to make Gogo have knee surgery and then make her swim during her recovery. But so be it, it would be for her own good, and that's part of being a good parent, right?

We went for our first session this past week. I asked the girl at the front if they're okay with dogs that <strong>despise</strong> water and she said that the therapists get the dogs acclimated in about 5 minutes. I have been watching "The Dog Whisperer", so I can believe in canine behavior miracles.

After the morning walk, I put Oz in the bedroom by himself and took Gogo for a walk. She was ecstatic to be walking with just the two of us. She would often look up at me with a huge smile to say "I'm so glad we're rid of that other one!" As soon as I walked up to the door of the hydrotherapy place, she started pulling to go home. I don't know what she was reacting to, it could have been the fact that she knew it was a day care place from the smell, or she could smell the water, or any number of things. We went in and I sat down on a bench next to the pool while Gogo growled at the other dogs (there were about 20 other dogs there for daycare - none of them swimming). I got to see the therapist with another dog before our appointment. It happily and lazily paddled in the water with not a care in the world.

We got "John" for the first session. I've since talked to dog store owners in the neighborhood and they all seem to know John or at least have heard of him. John's process of getting Gogo acclimated to water was to pick her up (she ran from him), and take her in the pool and let go. Gogo absolutely panicked. She paddled furiously towards me. She struggled to keep her head up. John grabbed her waist so that she couldn't make any progress but had to continue swimming to stay afloat. Here are some pictures:

She kept paddling with no end in sight. She kept staring up at me with pleading and terror-stricken eyes. Every five minutes, he would lift up her torso so that she could pant and catch her breath. He also stretched out her hind legs at the same time. After a short break, it was back in the water for more swimming. Time has never felt like it crawled along at a slower pace.

I have to admit that I wanted to leave. I didn't want to be witness to Gogo clearly having a horrible time. I smiled and encouraged her and tried to let her know that this was all perfectly normal. (Somewhere in the back of my mind, I have memories of mother doing the same to me, but I must have done a good job repressing them because none spring to mind immediately)

I noticed at the beginning that Gogo was not really using her hind legs. She would move them only an inch or two. I think that's part of the reason he was stretching out her hind legs during swimming. Sure enough, by the end of the session, she was using more of her back legs (though still not normal). And she eventually got used to swimming. I wouldn't say she enjoyed it, but she at least looked calmer:

We went two days later and had a different therapist. This one was a female. Gogo was happier because this meant that she was much more manipulable. Gogo spent much more time in "recovery" mode - a.k.a. being held in the arms of the therapist. She twice pretended that she was getting used to swimming by swimming circles around the therapist. The therapist would praise Gogo for her good swimming, Gogo would gradually increase the distance between her and the therapist, and would then bolt for the stairs to leave the pool.

I'm hoping to see a big change in another couple of weeks. Hoestly, it seems like she was walking a little straighter after the first session, so I'm pretty hopeful. They say that only about 1% of the dogs never quite enjoy swimming. I'm pretty sure Gogo is one of those, but I'm willing to suspend disbelief.&quot;;&quot;1150494673&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Oz’s Dip&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/oz/oz-s-dip&quot;;&quot;Today, I decided to take Oz with me to Gogo's swim therapy. He paced aorund the edge of the pool the whole time. Then at one point, he got crowded by dogs and decided to jump on in. Boy was that a mistake. He splashed around in a panic and tried to climb out the wrong end. He soon realized that he was trapped and couldn't get out. The therapist and I eventually led him over to the edge with the steps and he made it out. He kept trying to shake water out of his ears and sneezed for about 10 minutes.

Poor Oz.&quot;;&quot;1152196527&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Some Bad News&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/some-bad-news&quot;;&quot;I took Gogo to the vet that did her knee surgery today. He said that the second surgery was not fully successful and that her patella is still luxating. Ugh. That means he'll have to take her for another surgery and another recovery period. Ugh.

I was so extremely saddened to hear that news. On the trip to the vet I kept saying to Gogo that all the surgery is done, this is the last trip - just to make sure you're okay. Luckily, she doesn't understand English.

After they told me the news, they kept her for x-rays. I walked around the block a few times and called David and then Sis. A big part of me kept saying that I didn't have the strength to put her through this again. Having to get her up at 6am and take her to the animal hospital and leave her there for a couple of days and then trying to get her home and getting her to relax and sleep. It all seemed like a daunting task for which I had not reserved the emotional strength. I took some deep breaths and reminded myself that I shouldn't wish for life to change or for me to change - I should wish for better tools to deal with the things life throws at you. Anyway, it's not the end of the world - it's just one more surgery and hoepfully that will be the end of it.

I felt guilty about taking Gogo out to Fire Island for a week. I thought about having her surgery before we go. But no scenario made sense. I certainly didn't want to skip Fire Island and kiss $2000 goodbye. The doctor was encouraging. He said to let her go to Fire Island, run around, have a good time, and then try to have it done soon after getting back.

I also felt bad that I didn't bring her in for a check-up sooner. I kept thinking that if we had caught it sooner, we wouldn't have wasted all those weeks of recovery.

Oh well. Yuck. Poor Gogo.

That means the first week of recovery will be when Sis and Lorenz are here, so we'll have lots to distract ourselves, and lots of excuses to hang out at home with Lorenz and the pups.&quot;;&quot;1152910287&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Acclimating to Island Life&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/fire-island/acclimating-island-life&quot;;&quot;Gogo, Oz, and I are in day 4 of our week out on the island.

David and Rodrigo joined us on the first night and day, then our friends Kevin and Jeff came for the next two days. I really appreciated the company, because it took me a while to adjust to island life. Also, I like their company.
The cell phone reception in the house is spotty, there's no land line for phone, and there's no internet connection in the house. It's kind of a blessing because it gives me the isolation that I wanted, but I have to admit that it's a little more isolated than I was expecting.

The first couple of days, the dogs were a bit on edge. They didn't sleep so well because they were growling at all the strange noises. Every time they hit the beach they ran around and played non-stop. Last night was a shift: they slept thorugh the night, didn't wake me up, and when we walked on the beach, they primarily just trotted along. I think they finally got their "crazies" out.

So we've finished the phase of the vacation that's fun, running on the beach, walking to the pines, being social, etc. Now we're relaxed and ready to get some reading and writing done.
It's odd that it really takes a while for one's head to unclench and enjoy the lack of responsibility and schedule.&quot;;&quot;1153831528&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The End of the Good Puppies&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/fire-island/end-good-puppies&quot;;&quot;Up until yesterday, Gogo and Oz had been great on the island. I could let them off leash without any fear of them running away.

That ended yesterday.

I had noticed that they were starting to wander a bit further away from me on our walks, so  for our afternoon jaunt, I had decided to go through a path that's not usually travelled. It's open, sandy, and has little bushes and trees along the edge. They were great at first, a bit slow in fact - smelling every little leaf. Then they found something off the path that they liked and checked it out. I tried to keep walking hoping that they would notice me gone and follow. It didn't work. I wandered back to where they were, and they kept sniffing and wandered farther away. I tried various games to get the them to behave. None worked. Eventually, I got them back and put them on a leash.

I felt a little foolish because when I looked around, I saw that they hadn't really wandered far at all. They don't know the difference between walking on the path and wandering around the bushes. And no one was around. What's the worst that could happen? I let them off-leash again in the same area.

As I'm sure you can guess, this time they really took off and in opposite directions. I was fine until Gogo climbed up over a hill and disppeared. I waited for a minute for her to come bck, but she didn't. I ran up the hill and looked for her. There was a large grassy field, two more hills, and no Gogo. I panicked. Oz was in the opposite direction. I decided to try to get Oz first, since he was closer. Luckily, he cooperated. I put the leash on him and took him to where Gogo had last been spotted. I couldn't see a trail of her foot prints anywhere. Oz picked up her scent immediately and started pulling me, although we still didn't find her for a couple of minutes. She was on the beach, sniffing some seaweed and looking calm and happy.

Okay, so lesson learned. The dogs have gotten brazen in their explorations.

This morning, I was having brekfast at the house. There's a big deck in the back that the pups had been laying on to suin themselves, so I always leave the back door open. When I called them inside, Oz was nowhere to be found. I calmed my rising panic and started calling for him. It turns out that he wasn't far - just the neighbor's yard. He had squeezed through an 8 inch space behind the tool shed to get there. But he was having trouble getting back. He couldn't make it back and had somehow ended up in the stagnant swamp underneath the house and needed help clearing some old wood. I helped him the best I could, but it mainly came down to his determination to jump. His legs were covered with black swamp water. I hosed and dried him off.

I know I'm going to be tempted to take them off leash, but no more. They are now untrustworthy.&quot;;&quot;1153919688&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Practicing Fun&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nlp/practicing-fun&quot;;&quot;I had been stuck on my latest writing project. I spent a couple of months working together act breakdowns, scene breakdowns, character analyses, etc. I had all the pre-work done and ready to go, all I had to do was starting actually writing. I kept putting it off. So clearly something was wrong. I told myself that after I get the first couple of pages out, I'll get over my "fear" of writing and the rest will flow easily. I got myself to agree to only write 2 pages - to help me get over the initial hump. Those two pages came somewhat easily, then there was another delay. I found myself putting off work on writing.

My next strategy was to set aside one hour in which I could work uninterrupted. I did some NLP exercises to clear disctractions. I realized that I had a goal in my head that the writing had to be "good". I told myself that was ridiculous - it was a first draft for a whole play. The only goal is to get the whole structure down on paper. How could I expect to write in the wonderful details if I couldn't get my hands around the whole thing first? The deal I made with myself was that I had one hour to work. I didn't have to accomplish anything, but I wasn't allowed to be distracted. No checking email, no practicing piano for "just a couple of minutes", no checking the news. I was allowed to do whatever I wanted as long as it had to do directly with the script.

That went well and I got a few pages out of that hour of work. Then there was another several days where I could feel the act of working on the script turn into a "chore". Try as I might, I couldn't make the writing come any easier.

Then today, it hit me as I was practicing piano. I was working on Bach's Invention No. 4 and trying to get the last quarter of it. I kept thinking about the words of my piano teacher, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.robertcowie.com/">Robert Cowie</a>, that if you practice a piece in frustration and tension, you will have a hard time getting that out of your playing when you have learned the piece. It's much better to make the practicing easy so that you always have an experience of enjoyment and ease as you learn the piece. Ah...sage advice.

So today, the goal was to make writing fun! Make it easy! If I'm belaboring the writing, then only write the subtext. Write nonsense. Let the characters have emotional outbursts. Do whatever it takes to have fun.

Now that made a difference.&quot;;&quot;1156540339&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Private: Why Can’t You Take it With You?&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/religion/private-why-can-t-you-take-it-you&quot;;&quot;David and I are in Prague (which would explain the inevitable typos - the keys on the keyboard are often not where you expect them to be). He has a conference. I love Prague. I would never pass up an opportunity to visit. There's a wonderful mix of old European extravagance and communist era solitude.

We skipped the boat tour with the other anesthesiologists and had dinner last night, just the two of us, at a place called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.palffy.cz/en/index.htm">Palffy Palac</a>. The building is literally a palace. We climbed a tall and wide marble staircase to get to the restaurant. During communism, the palace was used to stock propaganda. Now it's both a private residence and a restaurant.

We had our choice of sitting inside or outside. The night was cool, the back was covered, so we ate outside. The back looked out over a beautiful garden. The setting was not ornate, it was stately. It's one of the things I love about visitting former communist areas - it's all very simple, clean, and quiet.

Anyway, the meal was out of this world. The service was so good, you feel as if the waiter would invite you to stay with him at Christmas. And halfway through dinner, I was overcome with a sudden sadness that there might be a point in time where I wouldn't remember this.

I believe in reincarnation. And I suppose that along with that, we somehow get our mind erased when we start the next life. Perhaps it makes it easier to enjoy the next life for its own sake to not carry around a bag of memories that no long matter. It all of sudden seemed so unfair that I couldn't have this memory with me always. Who's design was this? Why can't I at least keep my memories? Even if I could hold on to the impression of the memory, it's the sort of thing that I could take with me forever.

I got a little choked up at dinner. David didn't notice. The waiter showed up with our next course. I moved on. The whole night was really wonderful. And I wasn't even hung over this morning. This morning, I'm no closer to wrapping up my thoughts from last night. I guess it's not the sort of thing that gets answered. At least not in this lifetime.&quot;;&quot;1156748491&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Does Ambien Make You Stupid?&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/drugs/does-ambien-make-you-stupid&quot;;&quot;The answer: yes.

My <a href="http://christine.marran.com" target="_blank">sister</a> got me a Kakuro book a few weeks ago. It's a more complicated version of Sudoku that involves some basic math skills. I was very glad to get it as Sudoku was becoming quite boring.

Anyway, I took an Ambien for the flight to London, although I only slept for a couple of hours. The rest of the time I tried playing Kakuro. And I played some that night at the hotel. In a day's worth of travelling, I could only finish three games. On each game, I made at least one mistake and I eventually screwed up the puzzle so much I had to abandon it unfinished.

The next day we flew from London to the Czech Republic. In a matter of a couple of hours, I finished three puzzles without any errors.

Yikes.

&quot;Internal Frame&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/diet/internal-frame&quot;;&quot;Over the past year or so, I've been making a fair number of changes to my diet: eating healthier, trying to eat a greater variety of foods, not baking extravagant desserts, and eating less red meat and more fish. Although I felt better, I didn't lose any weight.

For exercise, I had been taking swing dance lessons, but not really at a level that would cause a major aerobic revolution. I had been staying away from exercise machines because they're boring and I always have a joint ache somewhere in my legs after all of that repetitive movement. I had also been taking yoga once or twice a week.

The past few weeks, I all of a sudden hit a big revolution. At the suggestion of my coach, I started lifting weights. I have had a personal trainer on and off - some good and some not so good. I once had the same personal trainer for about two years. Although I gained a lot of weight in muscle, I never lost as much fat as I wanted. My appetite would go through the roof after a workout. I'd feel like I literally couldn't eat enough. Plus, I never really liked going to the gym with my trainer. It was hard! I felt as if I was always on the border of getting an injury and I was constantly sore and stiff. To counteract all of that, my coach (who was a dancer and also practices Feldenkrais) gave me some activities to do to warm up my joints to avoid an injury. He also gave me a solid plan for working out that:
<ul>
	<li>Does not require hours a day at the gym</li>
	<li>Involves only three weeks of intense work outs followed by 9 weeks of maintenance</li>
	<li>Gives me a framework for what to accomplish and leaves room for some creativity so I don't get bored.</li>
</ul>
We also did some NLP work to help me get the best results from a workout.

I was quite surprised how quickly the changes took place. Within a couple of weeks, I could feel the difference and was getting compliments. However, the runaway appetite problem re-emerged. Which launched me on to my big discovery: portion control.

My coach had been talking about portion control for a while, but he really brought it home to me with a discussion of "internal frame" vs. "external frame" vs. "false internal frame". Let me try to summarize.

An "internal frame" is when you have your own set of standards, criteria, guidelines, processes, etc. on a particular subject. An "external frame" is when you find those things through an outside source - like a subject matter expert. And a "false internal frame" is when you think you have an inner set of standards, but really it's coming from somewhere else.

There are a lot of different ways that I could compare this to my personal experience. I think baking makes a good analogy. I spent many years putting myself through my own little "baking school". For instance, learning how to make croissants. The only thing I had in terms of an internal frame was that I knew how my own perfect croissant should taste, feel, and look like - but I didn't know anything about ingredients or technique. It took a few tries before I could internalize that process enough to say "I know how to make croissants". Now I have those skills and standards and I'm not looking for someone else to show me how to do it. Another good example is when I went through a macaroon phase last year. I made macaroons incessantly and tested about 10 different recipes. I made my own adjustments to the recipes, I learned how to make the recipes work with ingredients I knew I could easily get and with my own kitchen equipment. I now "know" how to make macaroons and I know how to judge whether they turn out well.

This also applies to computer programming. I "know" when I've written something sloppy and when I've written something solid and I have the skills to get me there. For a while, I didn't, so I read books and took advice from mentors until I could internalize that process.

So when it comes to eating, I see now where I hit a lot of limitations in diet. First of all, there's so much "diet" information out there that's just a list of foods to eat to lose weight without any regard for a maintainable and healthy way of eating (such as the Atkins or Scarsdale type diet books). I could never really internalize what I learned from those sorts of diets because they weren't anything that resulted in day-to-day food strategies.

Secondly, I have a lot of "false internal frames" about diet. I think they're part of my own process, but really, they come from some outside source. For instance, I went to pick up fish for David and me recently. I almost always say to the fish monger "2 of your larger steaks" or "2 good sized steaks". And my thinking behind that was always, "David and I are men and larger than average, so we should be eating larger portions." When I saw that thought for what it was - an false internal - I ordered one steak and split it in two after I cooked it. It still ended up being too much food, but not by much.

I should say that this discussion came after I had spent a couple of months checking in with myself as I was eating. I was no longer aiming for "full", I was aiming for "not hungry" or "sated". It's amazing how much sooner one can feel satisfied with food when you stop aiming for "full". The combination of my own empirical research and discussion of "internal frame" completely transformed my diet. All of a sudden, I was in charge of my diet. I know what I should be doing and take as much care with it as I would if I were programming or baking. I know how much I should be eating. There was no more guess work or feelings of guilt or doubt. Even if I have dessert, I never have enough food to cause a lot of damage. And the weird thing is, I don't feel like I'm depriving myself at all.

So the new rules are:
<ul>
	<li>Decide on the correct portion before you start eating</li>
	<li>Eat fresh veggies and salads first (they help you fill up)</li>
	<li>Eat only until you're no longer hungry</li>
	<li>If the part of you that wants to over eat seems to be winning the battle, envision everything else on the plate as animal fat (because that's what it will become)</li>
	<li>When you get hungry again, eat!</li>
</ul>
So far, clothes are much looser, but the scale hasn't gone down. That's to be expected because I'm gaining muscle from lifting weights. I'm trying to patiently wait for the day that someone that doens't know I've been trying to lose weight looks at me and says "oh my god, you look great"!&quot;;&quot;1156925448&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Hallelujah! Knees are fixed!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/hallelujah-knees-are-fixed&quot;;&quot;On Tuesday, it will have been six weeks since Gogo had her knee surgery. By the end of six weeks, the scar tissue is supposed to be in place and the majority of the healing is over. It was time to take her to the doctor to see if the latest surgery was successful.

I couldn't help but let my mind wander to what we would do if it wasn't successful. This has been the second surgery on the same knee and Gogo's third knee surgery overall. The recovery is awful. I feel terrible for Gogo, I have to carry her up and down stairs, I have to watch her like a hawk, and Oz doesn't get all the long walks that he wants. David had said that if this surgery wasn't successful, he didn't want to try again. I definitely see where he's coming from, but it would have been a hard call for me to make - especially if we saw her condition worsen over time again.

So it was with great anxiety that I took Gogo to see her surgeon, Dr. Fusco today. Well, good news, he said that the position of the knee is perfect! Yeah!

He said that we could increase activity, but to be on the safe side, don't do anything outrageous for another six weeks. He checked both knees and they both felt great.

I can't tell you what a huge relief it was to hear. I feel like a humungous burden has been lifted.

Please, God, please let that be the end of poor Gogo's surgeries.&quot;;&quot;1157734073&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;It’s the Most Mommie-less Time of the Year&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/children/it-s-most-mommie-less-time-year&quot;;&quot;We live next to a children's nursery and it's that time of the year when school starts. Which means for the next week or two, from eight to eight-thirty, I listen to the sounds of inconsolable children crying for mommy from the neighbor's backyard. Their suffering is bottomless. Most of the time it's a constant moan or wailing. Every now and then, one of them does a "I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE" sound. It goes on for so long, I can't help but laugh. I don't find their suffering funny - I find their vehemence funny. Some of the people that work there are trying to get a game of "Duck Duck Goose" going or trying to teach the kids a song. I think some of the kids are totally fine saying goodbye to Mommy and Daddy, but they are outweighed by the loudly inconsolable right now.

<p>My favorite mourner was from a couple of years ago. There was a kid that, for two solid weeks, spent every morning for a half hour crying "I WANT MY MOMMY. I WANT MY MOMMY. I WANT MY MOMMY."</p>

<p>I mentioned something about the kids to the nun next door. Something like, "Boy, the kids sure don't like the first week."</p>
<p>She said, "The children get over it soon enough. The parents never get over it."</p>

&quot;Applicious&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/food/applicious&quot;;&quot;Friends Kevin and Jeff invited me to go apple picking. I had never been. People talk about it all the time here in the Northeast. I sort of viewed as some quaint attempt to stay in touch with nature. On the west coast, most people either have an apple tree on their property or know someone that does. The idea of going out to pick apples always struck me as a bit silly. However, a fall day spent driving out to the country to hang out in an orchard sounds like a day well spent to me.
We went to a place called "Outhouse Orchards" in Westchester. Jeff said that it was not initially named after an outhouse. It had a Dutch name originally that sounded like "outhouse" that eventually morphed into the English. Jeff and I were both skeptical of that explanation.

Kevin had directions printed from Mapquest. The way to the orcahrd turned out to be very straighforward,  but you would never know that from the Mapquest directions. We took a total of 4 wrong turns, each one put us about 10 minutes out of the way. I was starting to lose my sense of humor on the final wrong turn. But once we got there, all of our mis-steps were forgotten.

Jeff got us three 1/2 bushel bags and we headed up a hill to the orchard. Once I got my bearings, I let the dogs off leash. They mostly stuck with us, sniffing and inquisitive. Eventually, they got comfortable and so started to wander away a bit more, so I put them back on leash for a bit. Once they calmed down, it seemed safe to let them off leash again. As soon as I did, they both took off running as fast as they could without looking back. They were heading towards some people that had entered the orchard with kids. I had to get them back on leash. Oz was relatively easy to get back, but Gogo totally disappeared from view. Kevin helped in the hunt and he found her. He said she was quite proud of herself for getting so far away. I had an apple as we were walking around. I have to admit, they were delicious - much better than anything you get at a grocery store.
We finished picking apples with the dogs on leash and headed back to the storefront. There were goats, geese, ducks, chickens, roosters, and rabbits on the property. Gogo and Oz were a bit tentative at first, but then decided they wanted a chicken.

Kevin and Jeff picked out a couple of pumpkins to take home and a homemade pie. We also got some homemade donuts for the trip home.

Getting home was relatively easy and uneventful. The pups passed out and didn't make a peep until we pulled into Chelsea.

I guess now seeing how much I enjoyed it made me realize that I do live in the Northeast and I don't have a lot of opportunities to hang out on a farm. And the puppies always enjoy the chance to run free in nature for a bit, as long as they can come home to a warm house and The New York Times chair.&quot;;&quot;1161701739&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Green Tea Chocolates!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/chocolate/green-tea-chocolates&quot;;&quot;For some reason, I decided that I wanted to make chocolates this year to give out to friends and co-workers. I've done some small experiments over the past couple of years with molded chocolates. They turned out reasonably well. But what I <strong>really </strong>wanted to do was to use chocolate transfer sheets to create designs on the tops of the chocolates. Transfer sheets are essentially colored chocolate printed onto acetate in a particular design. When you put melted chocolate on the transfer sheet, it transfers from the sheet to the chocolate.

Next up was to decide on flavors. I got the idea of doing different flavors representing different parts of the world. I brainstormed with some people to come up with the following list:

<blockquote><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pVD2fWJVXvHmhdP2RUVo3MQ">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pVD2fWJVXvHmhdP2RUVo3MQ</a></blockquote>

So now I'm testing the difficult recipes in preparation for the final production. The first difficult one was "Green Tea". I went to an Asian grocery store and got powdered green tea. Here's a picture of how they turned out:

[flickr-photo:id=2300521934]

And I must say, they taste great. I was worried that I put in too much powdered green tea, but the outside of the white chocolate blends nicely with the filling. It's excellent.

I think my next test will be the Brazillian - passion fruit and guava. I can't decide if I should make a white chocolate based filling like I did with the green tea or whether I should try a fondant filling.&quot;;&quot;1163213620&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Chicken with Dried Fruit and Almond Stuffing&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/main-ingredient/chicken/chicken-dried-fruit-and-almond-stuffing&quot;;&quot;This chicken is different from any I have ever tasted. The special flavor comes from the sweet, tart taste of the dried fruit, combined with the crunchy almonds. Stuff two chickens and don't worry about leftovers-it tastes just as good cold or reheated.&quot;;&quot;1204380256&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;A New Photography Class&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/new-photography-class&quot;;&quot;I came home from Israel with several goals. Most of the fitness goals are well in progress. I had also decided it was time to take a new class. I loved the photography class that I took at NYU, so I looked for a new class along those lines. I narrowed it down to a photographic lighting class and a portrait class. The lighting class seemed to have a more broader application, so I signed up for that.
<!--break-->

We've had 2 out of 10 classes. The class is great. 

My previous teacher definitely taught along the lines of "rules" - such as not to go over 800 ISO on the camera. Having those rules definitely helped me understand how to make better photographs and why one would make certain decisions. The new teacher, Don Penny, is the opposite type of teacher. One of the first photos he took in class was at an ISO of 1250. His basic philosophy is to first get the shot. He said there were photographers in the 70's that <em>always</em> shot at a high ISO because they wanted "grain the size of golf balls in their film".

So the class is much more experimental and free-spirited. 

In the first class he showed us a technique for checking our white balance. I had one of those "ah-ha" moments as I have occasionally had a whole batch of photos with a bluish tint that I just couldn't figure out why. Now I know why and how to fix it.

Why set up several lights in the class, took photos of each other, and compared the quality of the light on the subjects. It was amazingly fun and educational. He also knew the rough prices of all the equipment should we decide we're redy to start setting up a studio.

Our first assignment was to take photos in three different lighting situations: in noon-time sun, during the "magic hour" (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)</a>), and indoors where we control the lighting.

Here's my homework. I actually only showed the 8 best at class, but I posted a slightly larger set on flickr.

&quot;Dogs & Spring&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/dogs-spring&quot;;&quot;Our front yard has been completely re-done this year. In the past year or so, I put some potted flowers on the front steps. It makes a big difference to come home and see some flowers welcoming you. 

I told Benji that he should put some plants in the front yard. So he went all-out and lined the front with boxes and planters, expanded the watering system to take care of the front, and then flooded them with flowers. Our daffodils have been in full force. People have been stopping us on the street to tell us what a wonderful thing we've done for the block. I think people in New York really understand the preciousness of making some natural and beautiful in the midst of all the urbanity.

I took the puppies in the front yard for some nice photos.

&quot;A Day at the Central Park Zoo&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/jeff/day-central-park-zoo&quot;;&quot;Kevin had just started radiation. We wanted to do something special on the weekend. Our plans were to go to the Bronx Zoo, but the weather was not good and neither was Kevin's energy level. So we decided to go to the Central Park Zoo instead. We invited our friends Bob & Larry.
<!--break-->

Jeff happens to know someone that works at the Central Park Zoo, so Nicole got us all in for free, which was nice.

This was my first visit to the Central Park Zoo. It was small, but surprisingly nice. 

This was also the debut of Kevin's blond mohawk. He had decided that if there was a chance that he was going ot lose his hair during radiation, that he was going to go out with a bang.

&quot;The Birthday That Keeps on Giving&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/celebrations/birthday-keeps-giving&quot;;&quot;It's about ten days after my birthday and today has somehow turned into my great birthday celebration. I got a package this morning from Sis. It had the following:
<ul>
	<li>Two cookie presses</li>
	<li>Chocolates from Japan</li>
	<li>Japanese apricot liqueur</li>
	<li>A book of dog treat recipes with three cookie cutters</li>
	<li>A DVD about Blaxpolitation movies</li>
	<li>A Desi Arnaz CD</li>
</ul>
Whew! Pretty great.

Then I met Sara in Union Square and we walked around to some second-hand stores looking at clothes and furniture. I predicted that fashion next year will be all about the Brokeback Mountain look - rugged suede coats with fleece lined collars. We wandered up to Little India for lunch and had some of the best Indian food I've had in a while. The place is called <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/41750586/">Copper Chimney</a>. The chef came out to talk to us during lunch. And Sara said that lunch was on her - it was my birthday present because she couldn't find the original gift she had in mind.

So I came home and there was another package waiting for me: gift certificates at Barney's from Mom and Dad! Whoo-hoo!

Not bad for ten days after my birthday.&quot;;&quot;1138218240&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Joy of Picasa&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/google/joy-picasa&quot;;&quot;I think I had downloaded <a href="http://picasa.google.com/index.html">Picasa</a> once upon a time, said "that's it?" and uninstalled it. After a very strong recommendation from Sara, I gave it a second chance. It turns out that I didn't <strong><em>know</em></strong> I needed it.

It's software to help you organize your photos. That's really all it is. But they've put in every little feature you'll ever need. You can resize, crop, and re-color photos. You can have it make web-ready versions, automatically add it to a blog, create a CD, etc.

I installed it last night and let it do a scan of my hard drive for photos. First of all, I found photos that I had completely forgotten about. David and I spent a half hour reminiscing on shots of Gogo as a puppy and trips to Mexico. Secondly, I found out that I had been scattering photos all over the place. I thought I had been pretty good, but I found about 6 different folders dedicated to Gogo photos. This morning I finished moving files around, consolidating things, and touched up a few photos.

I can already see that this is going ot change the way I work with photos. I used to spend a very long time converting camera photos to web-ready versions in preparation to post on my site. Now I'm thinking I'll leave them in their native size from the camera, and do the conversion to web just when I need it.

I highly recommend <a href="http://picasa.google.com/index.html">Picasa</a>. It's free. It's made by Google.&quot;;&quot;1138278720&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Friday Night Ticket Scalping&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/friday-night-ticket-scalping&quot;;&quot;David is in Paris and we were scheduled to see "The Magic Flute" at the Metropolitan Opera. Since we ran out of time to exchange them, we had the choice of donating them to the opera for a tax-deductible donation or scalping them. I decided it would be fun to try scalping.

Let me say, it was quite an adventure. As most things in New York, you show up and realize there are people that make their living in front of the opera house scalping tickets. I would not classify them as opera lovers. I also discovered that having really good seats is a liability in the scalping business. At least 20 people said they were interested until they saw the location and price of the ticket. Some people just walked away from me without a word. Most people laughed and said "I'm looking for something MUCH cheaper, thank you."

There was a woman there that was dressed like a homeless person. She was very short, pushy, and spoke with a craggly voice. She came up to me at least 5 times. The first couple of times she would say "I'll give you $40 for it." I told her no way. On the third time, she said "What do you want for it?" I gave her my price and she walked away in disgust. She came up a couple more times to say something like "What did you say you wanted for it? I'll give you half that." It was clear that she was just trying to re-sell the ticket and was hoping that I was gullible.

There was another man there that I was convinced was trying to steal the ticket from me. He came up to me very amicably and said that he was trying to sell a ticket too. He did not seem part of the "opera crowd" - more like the Port Authority bus terminal crowd. He started off by saying "There's a bunch of moochers out here tonight. They don't want to pay f-ing anything for a decent ticket. What ticket are you trying to sell?" I held up the ticket and he quickly tried to pull it out of my hand. I held onto the other side and wouldn't let go. He looked and walked away. A couple of times I noticed him showing me. At one point I had the ticket in my hand by my side. I turned around and he had apparently been right behind me. He quickly turned and walked away as if he had been minding his own business.

I ended up getting lucky. I sold one of the tickets for full price within the first 15 minutes of being there. It was another 45 minutes before I sold the other one and I only got half price. Still, it beat the price that we would have gotten if he had dontated the ticket.&quot;;&quot;1138491389&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Google Strikes Again&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/google/google-strikes-again&quot;;&quot;For years I've been complaining that there are no programs that map public transit systems. It's great - especially travelling abroad - to be able to see where nearby subways are, how to get from one place to another via bus or train, etc. I was poking around Google today and ran across this...(lucky Portland)...<a title="http://www.google.com/transit " href="http://www.google.com/transit " target="_blank">http://www.google.com/transit </a>&quot;;&quot;1138573413&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Why do I care about del.icio.us?&quot;;&quot;business/blog/taxonomy/why-do-i-care-about-del-icio-us&quot;;&quot;If you browse the web, I'm sure you've heard about <a target="_blank" title="del.icio.us" href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. It's a site for maintaining links on the web. Like most of the sites out there that claim to be the hottest new technology, I shrugged my shoulders, said "meh", and forgot about it. Clever URL, but I don't need it.

The other day I was switching from my kitchen PC to my office and realized that I had lost a URL that I had bookmarked. Okay, I could see the advantage of having my bookmarks someplace central. So I set up an account on del.icio.us and converted my bookmarks. I was blown away. The product itself is great - not amazing. They've thought through a very simple, clean interface. The impressive part is to realize that you are participating in a world-wide effort to classify the web. The product gets really amazing as you "tag" your links. No more folders - just tags.

At first I was having a hard time coming up with a tagging scheme. I was taking my best guess at coming up with tags, but I wasn't entirely sure if I was naming them something useful. Then I started getting to some URLs that I shared with other people. If your URLs are in other people's account, you can see how other people have tagged them. You immediately plug yourself into a global organization scheme. It's really quite ingenious. Not to mention fast and efficient.

There are other great little things about the interface. For instance, no complicated tree structure for your tags. Instead, you can view your tags in a list or as a cloud. The cloud view is really cool and honestly helpful.

So then I started thinking about how this applied to various projects I had creating intranets at companies. I'm still sorting through my thoughts and wondering if it's a valid comparison. In intranet projects, there's usually some sort of problem coming up with a common language. Companies often complain that there is no central language - their keywords are a complicated mix of synonyms and double-meanings. There is an effort - and usually one person at the core of it - that comes up with a taxonomy that the system is built around. The tagging effort is never left to individual users of the system for the following reasons:
<ul>
	<li>Individual users can't be trusted to do any tagging whatsoever</li>
	<li>The taxonomy is too nuanced and complex for the users to understand</li>
	<li>Individuals will muddy the taxonomy</li>
</ul>
Well, seeing del.icio.us in action proves all of that wrong. If the general public can agree on a list of keywords to describe any page on the internet, maybe a company's taxonomy is not as subtle and convoluted as they'd like to admit? Maybe users are not as helpless and/or destructive as previously thought? Maybe it isn't worth maintaining a taxonomy so complicated that the average user can't automatically tag content?

A user would use the global taxonomy rather than create their own special language for things because it's in their best interest to do so. By adhering to the global taxonomy, you make it easier to find related content - both for yourself and the other people that use those tags.

In fact - why WOULD you trust all keyword tagging to be done by someone else? You know what a piece of content means to you - you should be able to use your own subset of keywords to describe that content. When I was tagging my own URLs, I would generally only use a subset of all the recommended keywords. My own set of tags has many to me, while also being applicable to other people with interests in those tags.

I don't think del.icio.us applies to all intranet metadata efforts. However, I've seen months spent on projects to come up with taxonomies that were frought with problems: the taxonomy was too confusing; items were either too broad or too detailed; it didn't address the needs of an individual; it was too cumbersome to maintain. There's a lot to learn from this system and they've solved many problems very elegantly. The real benefit is the trust and power that it gives its user to make a rich and meaningful experience.&quot;;&quot;1138900785&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Batman Returns Again Another Time&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/comic-books/batman-returns-again-another-time&quot;;&quot;I was re-reading Grant Morrison's "Bulletteer" yesterday. His "Seven Soldiers" is a lot of fun for the most part. I wish more people had picked it up. In the latest issue were two advertisements for upcoming Batman stories. The copy of "Bulletteer" is upstairs, so I'll have to paraphrase them for you.

One of the advertisements is for a mini-series called "Secrets". The ad has a beautifully drawn Batman and Joker. You can see a preview here: <a target="_blank" title="http://comics.ign.com/articles/677/677819p1.html" href="http://comics.ign.com/articles/677/677819p1.html">http://comics.ign.com/articles/677/677819p1.html</a>.

The other ad is for a mini-series called "Batman Year 100". Wired magazine did an article about the artist and author: <a title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/pope.html" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/pope.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/pope.html</a>. I wish I could find an image of the ad, because that's really what I'm going to rant about. The ad has a drawing of Batman and says "Gotham 2039. Fromt the shadows of a tortured city a forgotten champion rises again."

Ugh.

First of all, let me say that as soon as I read a little bit about both of these, they both sounded interesting. The artwork looks fantastic (especially on "Secrets"). These people spent a lot of time making something they thought the public would want to buy and I wish them all the success in the world.

And now my rant...

I'm so sick of Batman. Haven't we seen all these stories already? Several times, in fact. The only Batman stories I would find interesting at this point would be stories that get him to stop acting like a mopey, angry teenager. I came up with the following storylines.
<ul>
	<li>The Scarecrow finally figures out that he's been going about this all wrong. Instead of trying to poison Batman with fear gas, he posions him with anti-depressants. Batman gets over the death of his parents, his obsessive/compulsive disorder clears up, and realizes that it's a little silly to run around in a bat costume fighting crime. He takes up tennis instead. Eventually, he builds a resort town in Nevada.</li>
	<li>Gotham City goes through a real estate boom because it's the most affordable city in the country - due to years of crime keeping real estate prices low. Eventually, Gotham City becomes a bastion of art, culture, and nightlife. It becomes so expensive, that the criminals have to move someplace more affordable - like New Mexico. Batman finds himself living in a city that doesn't need him anymore. His attempts to bust up crime anger the now upper-class citizens of Gotham City. He spends his days dressing up as Batman and running around his own house pretending to solve crimes.</li>
	<li>Or how about something as simple as "Batman gets a steady girlfriend". He's had a few affairs, but for someone that keeps himself in such good shape, he clearly has pent up sexual frustration. In fact, I'm becoming very suspicious of super heroes that clearly don't get much, if any, sex. The more I think about it, the more I like this one. The Gotham City villains conspire to get him married off. They discover Batman's secret identity and somehow trick him into going on "8-minute dates". Bruce Wayne meets someone and falls in love. Eventually, the Batman thing kind of falls to the side. He has kids. Twenty years later, at suburban cook-outs, he contantly tries to tell people about the good old days: "I was Batman! Did you know that? Yep, that was me. Still got the costumes somewhere. We had to turn the batcave into a nursery for the kids."</li>
</ul>
I say all of this, but when the next Batman movie comes out (as long as it's directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/">Chris Nolan</a>), I will be first in line and salivating. Who am I kidding? I'll be the 1000th person in line behind all the people that buy anything that says "BATMAN" on it. The thing is, I still look forward to quality Batman stories. It's possible that these two new Batman mini-series wll be amongst those great stories. My point is, maybe we can all think about something that's not Batman? Maybe we can let the poor character take a break for a while? Maybe we can recognize that he's severely decompensated for a single tragic event in his life?&quot;;&quot;1139230236&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Baby Plaything&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/lorenz/baby-plaything&quot;;&quot;It's a shame that most babies don't realize how entertaining they are. I'm in Minnesota taking care of my sister and her husband while they attend to the baby. The baby is just now starting to look at his surroundings. It's still firmly in the "cry, eat, and poop" phase. However, the baby has provided us with endless amusement.

Sis was telling us last night that our mom had created little business cards with a picture of him and his vitals. We expanded it into a playbaby centerfold. Lorenz's turn-ons include "exposed breasts" and his turn-offs are "sleeping in my own poop" and "the hiccups".

We are endlessly amused at listening to him burp, which he does quite freely, or an audible poop or, as Mark calls it, a rocket fart. I tried to imagine what it would be like to burp so freely or - god forbid - poop my pants with abandon. I can't imagine. Maybe Freud has something there...

I stare at him and wonder what it must be like to exclusively make vocal sounds describing what's going on with my gastro-intestinal system. Besides the crying, you know when a burp or a fart is coming from the facial gyrations that he goes through and his grunts and moans.&quot;;&quot;1139782143&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Ah…Camille&quot;;&quot;creative/blog/religion/ah-camille&quot;;&quot;While in Minnesota, I picked up my sister's copy of Camille Paglia's "Sex, Art, and American Culture". I flipped randomnly to a chapter called "Sexual Personae: The Cancelled Preface". I read the following section:

<blockquote>Personality is at the heart of the West. Governing its representation in art are principles I call Apollonian and Dionysian, in a theory elaborated from passages of Plutarch, Nietsche, and G. Wilson Knight. These terms were used by German scholarship in a sometimes vague or portentous way. I fine-tune them for practical criticism. I see the Apollonian and Dionysian as a cyclic pattern of expansion and retraction, of the shapeless and the definite.</blockquote>

I have often used the model of Apollonian and Dionysian sides to art, long before Camille Paglia discussed it so fully in her writing. However, this phrase of hers resonated with me: "a cyclic pattern of expansion and retraction, of the shapeless and the definite".

I could apply that same notion to describe what it is I love so much about any piece of artwork or writing that has grabbed me: the ability to be at one point ineffable, and then to return to a state of something knowable. The best example I could give would be the X-Files at the height of the writing. The beginnings of the episodes seemed unreal and unknowable. The rest of the episode was about pinning down the edges of what was happening; giving shape to the events in unexpected ways.

I could also make the same case for sci-fi or comic books. My favorite books always start with something unreal, fantastical, and profound. Slowly that grandness retracts into something we can understand; something that is familiar and concrete.

I'm on the lookout now to see if this theory holds true and when it breaks. I'm trying to think of movies that might break this pattern. Even something like "Heavenly Creatures" perfectly captures this sentiment. The girls have wild flights of fantasy and we, as viewers, are taken into their surreal and bachannal flights. At the end of the movie, though, we are left with a very concrete view of what happened. It's really an amazing and transforming process.&quot;;&quot;1139982166&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Where is ritual in modern American culture?&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/where-ritual-modern-american-culture&quot;;&quot;I am just finishing up a week trip through Chiapas in Mexico. We attended two very important festivals, one was the "Pocho" dances in Tenosique and the other was "Fat Tuesday" in Chamula. If I don't have a full travelog posted now, I will soon. However, this post is more about my own thoughts and ramblings and is separate from the travelog.

The festivals that I attended where somewhat choreographed in that there was some sort of dance to be done that the townspeople knew and participated in. There were some sort of group of directors that would wave a flag, beat a drum, and somehow direct the action and the dances. And the festivals generally had a lot of references to animals, fertility, and the passage of death. They were profound to attend. I haven't had such vivid dreams in so long as I did after attending the festivals - and that's only as an outsider. I can't imagine what it would be like to actually participate.

So anyway, it got me thinking, where are the modern American rituals? And by ritual, I don't mean people's daily personal rituals like "I come home, open a bag of corn chips, and watch Roseanne reruns." Where are these group festivals? The best I could come up with was Puerto Rican Day or Gay Pride Day. I've seen these, though, and they don't even come close to stacking up. These seem to be more about getting drank, waving a flag, and shouting a lot. There's no group dance. There's no director.

I also thought about sports. I couldn't make the connection though. There's no real imagery, there's no real story being acted out, and there's really nothing for the audience to do.

I suppose the ritual is part of what always attracted me to Jewish/Israeli events like a wedding or a bar mitzvah. There is a dance and there is some form and story to it. Granted, there's nothing primal, so it's a little tame.

I suppose most religion was supposed to take the place of the rituals, but modern religion is so antiseptic by the standards of the festivals that I attended. It's a shame.&quot;;&quot;1141432408&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Be water, my friend&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nlp/be-water-my-friend&quot;;&quot;I was watching a documentary about martial arts movies and caught an interview with Bruce Lee. The following quote of his rang in my head like gospel:

<blockquote>Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way round or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.

Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend.</blockquote>

This is my new theme. I'm carrying this around in my head and savoring it like hard candy for the soul.&quot;;&quot;1141432542&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Yeah, Vertigo!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/comic-books/yeah-vertigo&quot;;&quot;I was lamenting (to myself) a few months ago that <a title="Vertigo Comics" href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/">Vertigo Comics</a> had really let itself go. It seemed that the majority of their publications were re-hashing past successes like The Sandman or Swamp Thing. And a lot of the new stuff was fairly realistic crime comics like DMZ, 100 Bullets, or The Losers. Basically, stuff you could find elsewhere. I thought Vertigo was about pushing the envelope and providing an outlet for high-end alternative comics?

As if they heard me, Vertigo has recently released three new titles - all of which are worthy of picking up:

<a title="American Virgin" href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5009">American Virgin</a> - <span class="display_copy">This is fun and is the most different from the average comic fodder. There's only been one issue so far, so it's hard to judge. I liked what I read so far and the author started a lot of threads that can go somewhere interesting.
</span>

<blockquote><span class="display_copy">Adam Chamberlain is a 20-year-old youth minister, a best-selling author, and most important, the head of a rabid national virginity movement. But practicing virgin or not...Adam is about to lose it.</span>

Just a few weeks shy of marrying the girl of his dreams — the only woman God has said he can ever know sexually — Adam's fate, future and sex life are cast in direct opposition with God's Word.</blockquote>

<a title="The Exterminators" href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=4761">The Exterminators</a> - If you can handle it, this is a fun and twisted series. It's definitely not for the faint of heart. But it's also not pointlessly mean-spirited. By issue #3, it starts to poke its head out of the murky angst that it's mired in.
<span class="display_copy">
</span>

<blockquote><span class="display_copy">The series centers on a dysfunctional group of bug killers prowling the barrios and bungalows of Los Angeles — the thinnest point on the shaky borderline between civilization and the violent chaos of nature. </span></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=4584">Testament</a> -  It's a little too soon for me to be able to say what this series about. So far, it's taking stories from the Old Testament and applying them to a sci-fi future based around issues that we see in play today's government - privacy, war and recruitment. Here's the DC blurb about it:
<blockquote><span class="display_copy">From the imagination of best-selling author Douglas Rushkoff (<em>Coercion, Club Zero-G</em>), one of the most iconoclastic and acclaimed minds of our era, comes a series that exposes the "real" Bible as it was actually written, and reveals how its mythic tales are repeated today. </span></blockquote>
<span class="display_copy" />So there you go. Smart, interesting, and alternative comics. Go for it. Buy en masse.

I've often thought the problem with the modern comics market is that everyone associates comics with costume clad superheroes. There's no reason to think that:
<ol>
	<li>Just because the characters are superheroes doesn't mean it's vacuous</li>
	<li>Not all comic books are about superheroes</li>
</ol>

If the comic industry is to grow to its next step, it's getting more people to buy comic books by convincing people there's more out there than just kid stuff.

So congratulations to Vertigo for pushing the boundaries. I hope they get the support they need to continue.&quot;;&quot;1142349764&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Great Migration Begins!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/technocrat/great-migration-begins&quot;;&quot;How many years have I had my old site? I think it's been at least 8 years. It's been time for an overhaul for a while now, but the task was much bigger than I could have imagined. I did a quick page count of my site and found several hundred pages that had to be migrated. Some of them I could migrate automatically, but the vast majority would have to be ported over by hand.
<!--break-->

This was mainly due to the fact that I had significantly upgraded much of the technology. I wasn't just copy and pasting text over, I was moving pictures to my flickr account so that it easily went into an automated slide-show, I was re-tagging content, recipes were being put it into a database so that you could easily double or quadruple amounts, etc.

So not all of the content is over yet. Everything that was once under "blog" is moved over. In some cases, I enhanced the blog entry (especially where photos were involved). I've only moved over one recipe so far. My next goal is to finish moving over recipes.

And then on to everything under "photos" in my old site. Yuck. I'm not looking forward to that.

The benefit will be a new look and feel, the ability to add comments to any page, enhanced keyword tags, spam-blocking, cool new slide shows, forward-to-a-friend, search-engine-optimized pages, and eventually a section of business and creative work.

I hope you like the site! Let me know what you think or if you find a bug by leaving a comment.

&quot;Photography Class&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/learning/photography-class&quot;;&quot;I just finished taking a month long photography class. I had been talking to my friend, Tom, about my photography skills. I felt that after I got a high-end DSLR camera, that my photos actually got worse. I had no idea what all the buttons were for. Every time I tried to figure out f-stop and shutter speed, I'd take lousy photos. I really needed a class to get me into shape.

We looked at a few classes in the city. In the end, we took a "Digital Photography Workshop" from NYU. The instructor was Emmanuel Faure (http://www.emmanuelfaure.com/). 

The class was invaluable, in that it forced me to understand everything that my camera does and why you would pick particular settings over others. The teacher also gave us a lot of advice on composition, framing, and other artistic ideas.

The latest photos on my site were all done during or after the photography class. I've definitely noticed a night-and-day difference. I would occasionally take a good shot before, but now I can hit it with much more reliability. And when I'm not hitting it, I know what I can do to fix it.

This is a photo of our class, taken by the instructor.

&quot;Some Hiccups&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/technocrat/some-hiccups&quot;;&quot;The new blog has been up a while. There's still no progress on moving over all the old content to the new site. It's feeling like a herculean task right now.

And I found a few hiccups.

If you browse the site with IE 6, it looks terrible. I make no apologies. UPDATE YOUR BROWSER! I toyed with the idea of putting a big block on the site just for IE6 users to upgrade their browser, but then I figured I didn't want to waste time making any concessions for IE6. It's an old browser and it's not compliant. Everything will look better if you use a newer browser (preferably <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>).

The other big hiccup that I found is that Google Analytics was not turned on correctly. So I have no idea if anyone actually browsed the new blog pages. And seeing that no on has left a comment yet...well it's left me in the dark. 

Please don't hesitate to leave a comment if there's something about the site that's not working correctly.&quot;;&quot;1212014777&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;My First Body Scrub&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/beauty/my-first-body-scrub&quot;;&quot;This past week, I decided it was time for a spa visit. My friend Sara insists that I have been sorely lacking in my spa-attending duties, so it was high time I booked myself for an appointment. I had originally thought a massage and a waxing would be a good idea (Yes, yes, men can get waxed too. It really helps cool off for the summer.) I booked an appointment at Nickel (http://www.nickelspanyc.com), which is just a block away. 

The day before the appointment, I decided I really didn't want a waxing. So I decided to try something different, I got a massage followed by a body scrub. I didn't know what to expect and decided to be surprised, rather than ask anyone what it was like. 

The massage was great. It was with a masseur that I had not had before. His name was Omar and he was gargantuan. I had signed up for a sports massage, so I expected him to really work any tension out of my muscles. Mission accomplished.

He did the body scrub as well. He started by putting warm, wet hand towels over my front (I was lying down). Then he poured warm water over the towels. One by one he took the towels away and scrubbed the skin with a loufah. The only area of my skin that was a bit sensitive to the scrubbing was my lower legs. I had a brief moment when he started scrubbing my sides that I was going to break out in ticklishness, but I held my composure. After he did the front, I flipped over and he did the same thing to my back half. At the end, I was covered with soapy water. He showed me my robe, a clean towel, sandals, and pointed me to the shower down the hall.

The treatment is certainly not for people that are drip-phobic. There was water being poured all over the place. A was a big sudsy mess by the end of it. There's something very child-like to having someone scrub you while you just lay there.

Yes, my skin was soft and smooth afterwards. I would definitely sign up for another one.&quot;;&quot;1214256026&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Out at Buck's Lake&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/out-bucks-lake&quot;;&quot;We drove almost directly from the Sacramento airport to Buck's Lake. It's about 45 minutes from Sacramento to Yuba City and then another 2 hours to Buck's Lake. 

It did not occur to me to call David while in Yuba City. It wasn't until I got to Buck's Lake that I realized there was no internet or cell phone reception. Yikes! At first, I thought I'd be fine with the break. It turns out that I was wrong. During the second day at Buck's Lake I took my iPod Touch for a walk around the lake until I found internet access to poach. I must have looked quite out of place with my sunglasses, Kenneth Cole jacket, and iPod sitting on a stump and sending email.

Buck's Lake is beautiful. The cabin has been in the family for a long time - my mom played in the lake when she was a child. Her first honeymoon was in the cabin.

Over the years, my uncle Parke has significantly altered the cabin: he rotated it 90 degrees to get a better view, he's expanded it both out the sides and on top.

The first night and day we had Aunt Catherine, Uncle George, and Uncle Parke as company. We built a fire at night and gave Lorenz his first s'mores. His face was smeared with chocolate and marshmallow in no time. 

The next night, Uncle Chris arrived with Dad. We had a great visit. It's a good place to unwind and talk.

Lorenz was unfortunately not so comfortable there. We had a hard time getting him to relax and go to sleep. At one point, Sis and I took him out on the boat. There must have been something about the rumble of the motor, because he went out like a light as soon as we got out in the water. Sis and I put a blanket over him so he didn't burn and had a nice slow circle around the lake. 

We took Lorenz out another time and he stayed awake. This time I took the boat fast, which scared him at first. In no time, he was asking to go faster.

&quot;At Beth & Charlie's&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/beth-charlies&quot;;&quot;For most of the rest of the week, we stayed at Aunt Beth's & Uncle Charlie's. 

Uncle Charlie has spent most of his life working at John Deere. Hence, there is a LOT of John Deere paraphernalia around the house.

Charlie took Lorenz on a ride on a "gator". For you city folk, it's a four-wheeled utility vehicle made by (whom else) John Deere. Here's more information: http://www.deere.com/en_US/ProductCatalog/GC/category/GC_UV.html. Lorenz went NUTS getting to ride in this. Just about the only two words that he said crystal clear the whole weekend were "marshmallow" and "gator". 

And Lorenz wasn't the only one. Beth and Charlie's dog Coda was ecstatic for the ride. And Aunt Catherine's glee is quite visible as well. Charlie seems to be the only keeping his cool.

You may also notice the fetching pink swimsuit with a frilly skirt and multi-colored daisies. It was the only life vest that Lorenz. He didn't mind wearing it. We'll see if he retro-actively minds having worn it when these pictures are shown to future prom dates. Thank god for the internet - these photos may be here for a long time!

&quot;Visiting Uncle Scott and Aunt Grace&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/visiting-uncle-scott-and-aunt-grace&quot;;&quot;Sis and I got a chance to visit Uncle Scott (from my father's side) and his wife, Grace, while we were there. This is only the second time I've seen him in the past ten years.

They took us for a drive through the Buttes (my first time driving through them) to a restaurant/bar on the Sacramento river called "Lovey's". It was a great location that had it been anywhere else in the world, would have been packed with boats and swimmers. Thank god there are still places like Sutter County in the world. 

We had a great visit and got to get a picture in as long as it somehow featured Scott's boat.

[flickr-photoset:id=72157605720025524]&quot;;&quot;1214344431&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Sutter County Cemetery&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/sutter-county-cemetery&quot;;&quot;On the way out to Lovey's, Scott drove us by the Sutter County cemetery and pointed out that our birth father and grandparents are buried there. After lunch, both Sis and I wanted to drive back and see Keith Sr's grave. I had never seen it and Sis had only been when she was very young.

We thought that we could locate it by finding the cemetery's office, but that was closed with no directions. We thought we could locate it by walking around, but it became quickly clear that a cemetery, no matter how small it looks, is a big place. We wandered for a while where we thought we would see it with no luck. I was becoming increasingly discouraged - not to mention depressed by looking at all the tombstones. I couldn't help creating little stories in my head about the people buried there or wondering what had happened to them.

Then I remembered that one of the first things I did when Google first became popular was to Google my own name. The first thing that came up was the Sutter County cemetery records for Keith Sr's grave. I used my phone to search for that page again and found the location of his grave. It turns out that we were no where near it. We got back in the car and found it. 

I was not in the right state of mind when we found it - staring at everyone else's graves had put me in quite a funk. Still, I'm glad that we did it. I don't know why I'm glad and I don't know what it was I was hoping to get by finding it. Truth be told, it put me in a funk for the rest of the trip - one that has slightly lingered to this day.

I never knew that he made it to be a doctor.

&quot;Kellie & Paul's Wedding&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/kellie-pauls-wedding&quot;;&quot;And now for the big event: Kellie & Paul's Wedding!

The big debate leading up to the wedding was "Who's Wearing a Tie?". Well, shockingly few men wore a tie. Or not so shocking, considering the Everetts. I was one of the few wearing a tie. I had a nice linen suit for summer events, so I figured it would be silly not to wear it to an event in Yuba City. And I wasn't going to schlep a suit all the way to California and not wear the whole enchilada. 

I guess I looked the part of a New Yorker, because several people said to me "Coming to Yuba City from New York must be a big culture shock!" Did I have a wide-eyed blank stare of fear and confusion? I hope not. 

The wedding was beautiful. And thankfully the ceremony was not overly long because linen suits do not "breathe" as much as advertised and it was a typical Yuba City day of pounding sun with not a cloud in the sky.

It was a great reception. There's never quite enough time to connect with cousins and catch-up. I keep thinking there will come a day when I'll finally get to sit down and hear what people have been doing with their lives, but before you know it, another 5-10 years have passed by.

&quot;Retouching Photographs&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/retouching-photographs&quot;;&quot;I've started playing around with Photoshop to enhance my photos. 

I was looking at the wedding photos done by the professional they hired for my cousin's wedding. They were fantastic. You can view them here: <a href="http://artisticimagery.blogspot.com/2008/06/kellie-and-pauls-wedding.html" target="_blank">Kellie and Paul's Wedding</a>. Her composition is excellent, the pictures are sharp, and she certainly gets a great sense of playfulness from her subjects.

There's also a lot of post-processing in her photos. I don't know everything she's doing, but I can that there are adjustments to color and saturation for starters.

I decided to play around with some of my existing photos to see if I could breathe some life into them. 

I experimented with curves, an unsharp mask, and vignetting in Photoshop to alter the image below.

Here's the original (You definitely want to zoom in to the photo. It looks a lot better close-up):

[flickr-photo:id=2616807428]

I went to "curves" in Photoshop and modified the red and green channels to have a slight "s" curve. I left the blue channel as it was. I then applied an unsharp mask to the image. I aimed for a radius of 50 on the unsharp mask and played with the other settings so that it wasn't too severe. Next, I added a filter of an "inner glow" and changed the color to black. That gave it a soft vignette. 

When I look at the after photo, I start thinking that I didn't too that much, but when I go back to the original, I see how washed-out the original now appears.

Here's the final image:

&quot;A Trip to Yuba City for Kellie & Paul's Wedding&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/trip-yuba-city-kellie-pauls-wedding&quot;;&quot;In June 2008, Mom, Dad, Sis, Lorenz, and little old me rendezvoused in Yuba City. The event that brought us there was the wedding of my cousin, Kellie Everett (Parke's daughter). It gave us a chance to visit Buck's Lake, where Parke has a cabin that's been in the family for decades, hang out in Yuba City, visit Uncle Scott, and have a good ole Everett time.

You will notice that Aunt Catherine is in more than her fair share of photos. That's because she's a ham. Plus, she's photogenic.

Enjoy the photos.&quot;;&quot;1214348726&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Aunt Beth's Garden & Greenhouse&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/aunt-beths-garden-greenhouse&quot;;&quot;On recent trip to Yuba City, CA, I took some time to take photos of Aunt Beth's garden and greenhouse. I should say - take photos of a small fraction of her garden and greenhouse. There are lots of vegetables, herbs, and fruit trees there - unfortunately, I was there a bit early in the season before the plants had a chance to get going. I was still able to get some good shots.

The orchid greenhouse is amazing. Aunt Beth told me that there was very little in bloom this time of year. What I saw was still enough to amaze me. It seemed that every time I turned around, there was another orchid bloom that I had missed. Each one was more strange and wonderful than the last.

I have no idea what kind any of these are, so they are all labeled generically.

&quot;Oz Organizes Comic Books&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/comic-books/oz-organizes-comic-books&quot;;&quot;I've been having a hard time lately with a few comic book series. I've been obsessed with Batman lately - it's one of the best comic series I've read in years. I was talking to a friend saying that I was enjoying it, but that it was hard to follow. He summarized his favorite parts of the story and it was all new territory to me. I had no idea what he was talking about. Then I went back and noticed that i was missing about 3 issues over the past year. That's a lot.

I looked at another series that I like called "The Twelve" and it was a similar story: missing issues.

So I decided it was time to organize my comic books again. There are stacks of books all over the house. When I look for a missing issue, I have to go into 4 different rooms to look through stacks. 

I went to the comic store and got some boxes, bags, and boards. I figured that 100 should be enough. As I went through the stacks to organize them, I realized that I hadn't organized my comic books since the series "52" ran - which was about two years ago. They had a comic book a week for one whole year. That series alone was 52 issues. I probably had about 200 - 300 comic books to bag, board, and organize. Yuck.

So today's goal changed into "let's at least organize and stack the comic books and then figure out what to do". I made it that far and stood up to take a break. Oz either liked the warm spot that I left on the rug or felt like he needed some attention, because he grabbed my spot as soon as I got up. Here's a photo of him.

Awww...

&quot;Waiting for the iPhone 3G&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/apple/waiting-iphone-3g&quot;;&quot;All in all, childhood is not something I want to experience all over again. I didn't like the general helplessness, lack of knowledge, the clashes with authority - and of course, the waiting. The endless waiting for...say, The Return of the Jedi to come out. I think I was in a 2-3 years depression as a small child knowing that Han Solo was frozen, Luke was missing a hand, and the Empire was still on the march. I don't think kids in general are good at waiting. Well now I get to relive all that waiting again. 

WILL THE IPHONE 3G JUST HURRY UP AND COME OUT ALREADY!?

My friend Sara and I have made plans to stand in line at 7am on Friday morning at the AT&T store. We predict that this iPhone release won't be as much of a zoo as the first release. I don't know what we're basing that on. Maybe we just assume that the rest of the world isn't as superficial materialistic as the two of us.

My current phone is beautiful (It's an AT&T 8525). It's been my favorite phone by far and has been leaps and bounds ahead of most everyone else's phone. I've loved it - until they announced the iPhone 3G. Now every time I look at my current phone, I have this "oh, you again" response to it. There are plenty of glitches in Windows Mobile, the browser sucks, I can't sync reliably, and I reboot almost once a day. I can't wait to ditch it.

The real kicker is that I know that Apple is working my ultimate device: an iPhone that has a physical keyboard and 32GB. Once I get one of those, I can die a happy man. Every few days I tell myself that I should just wait until that one's ready. It's only 6 months to a year, right? But I can't wait. I'm helpless against wanting an iPhone. Every time I check email on my Windows Mobile phone, I think about how much easier it's all going to be on an iPhone. Then I settle it with the thought that I promised my current iPod to Rogrido when the new iPhone came out. Poor Rodrigo doesn't have any iPod, so it's really selfish of me to NOT get an iPhone and give him my hand-me-downs.

At the beginning of the week I thought that the time would fly by and that Friday would arrive sooner than I could expect. I was wrong. The week is dragging by. Is this why they say time flies when you're older? Because when you're a kid, you're trying to kill time waiting for the next shiny new thing to come out.

&quot;Screw You, Apple! I don't need your stupid iPhone!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/apple/screw-you-apple-i-dont-need-your-stupid-iphone&quot;;&quot;Today was the big day: the release of the iPhone 3G. We had a multi-tiered plan - I was going to check out the Apple Store near my house at 7am, Sara was going to check out the AT&T store nearest her, and her friend Morgan was going to check out the Union Square AT&T store. Whoever had the shortest line would grab a spot and we would all meet there.

The Union Square store won - although the Apple store near my house looked like the most fun. The people in line had giddy faces, there was a camera crew, and the windows of the store were covered in black fabric.

I went to Union Square and we all waited in line. About an hour and a half into the waiting, someone that knew Morgan came to say hi, saying that he was further back in line from us. We chatted for a bit and then he said the inevitable: "So do you think I could join you guys in line?"

Silence. Sara and I looked to our feet. Morgan murmured something like "I don't think anyone would say anything." The guy said that he'd be right back and returned with his female business partner. It turns out no one said anything about them butting ahead in line, and they were great company - but I had started rehearsing in my head what I would say if anyone else tried to join us.

We noticed that, with the exception of the first person to walk out the door (who did a cheer), everyone was leaving the store in a dour mood. We figured that people should be excited that the fruits of their waiting labor were finally ripe. People just seemed to be slinking out of the store with a bland look on their face.

We got into the store after about a 2.5 hour wait in line. I assumed that it would go smoothest for me since I was the only existing AT&T customer, and I have already checked that I was eligible for the upgrade to an iPhone. The salesperson took my information, then said that she had to talk to the manager. Apparently, the AT&T computer said I was eligible, but iTunes had said that I was not. Why it mattered what iTunes had to say was beyond me - I think there were some competency issues. Especially considering that the guy that had my sales agent before me had the exact same issue. They asked me to step aside while they checked it out.

I actually don't think they did that munch to fix the issue. I waited for about 20 minutes. My sales agent went through two more customers while I waited. Sara got her iPhone, but they were not able to activate the service. They told her to wait as well - but that it should activate sometime in the next hour or so.

I talked with the manager who tried to care about my situation, but couldn't do anything to help. Customer service had flown out the window. I was a drop in the bucket of iPhone consumers. I could leave an unhappy customer and they wouldn't bat an eyelash. So I decided to leave. God knows how long I would have had to stand there in the store with no resolution. 

While I was standing there debating leaving, Sara and I were playing with their demo models. For some reason, a piercing store alarm went off on my demo iPhone. The little cord that keeps you from stealing it started flashing a red light. They had to have someone come over, open up the panel, and manually shut off the alarm. I was embarrassed at first, then slightly glad it happened. I toyed with the idea of doing it again in the hopes that they would give me an iPhone just to have me out of the store.

Sara and I left with those same bland and dour faces that we saw on everyone else. I had no iPhone and hers was unactivated. We had coffee at Taralucci y Vino. I felt better about my iPhone-less existence.

I stopped by two AT&T stores on the way home. Both of them were sold out. It was only 11am. How had I so seriously misjudged my fellow Americans ability to participate in a consumer frenzy?

I thought I'd swing by the Apple store on the way home. Maybe the line wasn't that long? It wasn't outrageous in the morning when I stopped by...

It was ridiculous. It snaked back and forth and went halfway to the river. They had handed out Apple umbrellas to people standing in the sun. I heard that they had even given out cookies! Clearly I had picked the wrong line.

Then the sour grapes started setting in. I didn't need a stupid iPhone. Maybe this was God's way of telling me to wait for the 32GB version? If so, thank you God for caring about my technological well-being. And maybe I shouldn't be so gung-ho about something this popular. When did Apple go from underdog to market crusher? Suddenly, I started feeling like a Jonestown member complaining that my cup was empty - "Don't tell me you're out of Kool-Aid! That's not fair!"

Maybe I'll wait for the Google Android...

It looks like I'll try again at the Apple store tomorrow morning. There's a slight chance that the line won't be bad and that they may still have phones left and that they had worked through my eligibility problem. Not bloody likely, but worth a try.

I went home and the plants on the front steps needed water. It was a good reminder - plants need water to live. Water is a necessity. iPhones are not.&quot;;&quot;1215794227&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Um...I take it all back...&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/apple/um-i-take-it-all-back&quot;;&quot;So...this morning I stood in line again for an iPhone. Am I being masochistic? Do I really not have anything better to do with my time? 

These were some of the nagging questions chattering in my mind that I squelched as I stood in line hoping to get an iPhone.

I decided to try my luck at the Apple Store because they stood a better chance of having everything in stock and their employees seemed nicer and smarter. When I got to the store a half hour before opening, the line was even longer at opening time than it was the first day. After the first hour of waiting in line, my mind did a big "What are you doing wasting another 3-4 hours? Just wait a week and there will be no line! There's no guarantee that you'll even get an iPhone!" I justified that if I left now, that would be completely wasting a full hour. If I stuck it through, I would at least make the waiting worth it.

I was visited by Jeff and Scout, then Kevin, and finally David. I waited in line a bit over 4 hours. I won't say the time went by quickly, but it didn't feel quite as bad as four hours. 

The final line is on the second floor. They let 6 people go up to the second floor at a time, where you wait for an agent. Luckily, David showed up right as I was given the pass to go upstairs, so he got the fun of the purchase without the pain of the waiting. There really is something to be said for waiting for something for 4 hours. By the time I ascended the glass stairs, I felt like I was entering heaven (although getting an iPhone was feeling a lot more difficult than getting into heaven). In a couple of minutes, a sales agent came over and introduced herself. 

Her name was Erica. She smiled. She asked me how long the wait had been. She said that they're getting better - yesterday it was an average of 7 hours wait. She only asked me a few questions and then went to get my iPhone. Gone was the disarray of AT&T, the confusing responses that the computer wouldn't let my order go through, the general dismissal of my needs. I got the sense that Erica was going to get me an iPhone no matter what. She was looking out for me. We chit-chatted about the neighborhood. Her cousin has crashed on her futon for the past week. Erica was cool.

I asked her how the system was going to transfer my phone number over. Didn't she need to switch my SIM card? She had only asked my name and phone number. How could it figure out who I was? She walked over to a Mac, plugged in the iPhone, and two text messages to me from Jeff came up on the iPhone. It found me already. I couldn't figure out if I should be creeped out or amazed. Where were the 2 hour activation times I had been hearing about? This was instantaneous. Sara got her iPhone at AT&T over 24 hours earlier and it had still not activated.

Erica kept talking politely at this point and was holding my iPhone (it was now mine. - mine mine mine - gimmee gimmee). I was trying to be polite, but really, I wanted to snatch it out of her hands. David kept up the conversation as I stared intently at my iPhone. Eventually, she gestured in a way that could have been interpreted as offering me the phone and I grabbed it. She wished us well and went on to make someone else's day.

When we descended the lucite stairs to leave, I felt like I had to leave the place with a smile. I had seen so many people leaving the AT&T store disgruntled. I owed it to the people still standing in line (hundreds of them, in fact), that yes, there is an iPhone at the end of their journey and it will be worth it. I beamed a smile. I cheered. It turns out the people in line didn't care about me at all, but the other employees cheered with me and opened the door for us to leave.

I've been playing with it for a few hours. I can't explain what's so great about it, but it's the coolest gadget I'ver ever owned. What's so great about it? Everything. Every little detail makes you go "neat!" and "wow!" and "they've thought of everything!"

That's what's so great about Apple products, they inspire this weird possessive/personal/devotion response to electronic devices. You can almost hear yourself saying to the Gods of Apple: "You can make me wait in lines for ever and I'll still be there for you."&quot;;&quot;1215903996&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;..Across the Fruited (and apparently slick) Plains!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/beauty/across-fruited-and-apparently-slick-plains&quot;;&quot;I saw this blurb about the latest Miss Universe pageant:

<cite>AP - Miss Venezuela was crowned Miss Universe 2008 on Monday in a contest marked by the spectacle of Miss USA falling down during the evening gown competition for the second year in a row.</cite>

I immediately stopped what I was doing and searched for videos of our proud Miss USA spilling out for both 2007 and 2008. Granted, it wasn't the same person (that would have been hysterical if it had been the same girl - cursed to a life of slipping on stage during inopportune moments). Still, it's funny that it should happen to us. 

Are they going to change the Miss USA competition? Maybe they should add a "walking on difficult surfaces" portion to ensure that we have able walkers for the Miss Universe contest.

Here's the video from both years:

[video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Q20Rq2m8c]

Miss USA 2007 definitely wins the "total unrecoverable wipe-out award". Were there ball bearing in her heels? 

Miss USA 2008 does a great job of recovering. She applauds herself. You almost suspect that she's drunk.

&quot;4 Nights in Fire Island&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/fire-island/4-nights-fire-island&quot;;&quot;The past two years, I've rented a place on Fire Island for a week - specifically, in Cherry Grove. Previously, I had taken the pups out, got a 2 bedroom unit, and attempted to get work or writing done.

This year, I decided to bag the trip to Cherry Grove for a few reasons: finances were tight, we had a lot of travel this year, the dogs kind of drive me crazy out there, I never got any writing done, etc. On 4th of July weekend, it all of a sudden hit me that I'm supposed to be walking on the beach with the sand between my toes and the surf running over my ankles. I went on craigslist and found a <a href="http://www.bauhausfireisland.com/index.htm" target="_blank">studio apartment on the bay</a> for only during the week for a reasonable rate. No pets allowed - so sorry puppies, you have to stay with David.

I scheduled it to coincide with a trip that Kevin and Jeff were making to Bellport (a 15 minute drive from the Cherry Grove ferries). They were staying for a few days at the house of Kevin's doctor who had graciously offered them his house for some needed R&R. I spent the first day and night with them, then we all went to Cherry Grove together the next day where I stayed for the rest of the week.

Looking back on it, I can't really tell you what I did. Without any puppies or a phone that could get reception I slept. A lot. Pretty much every activity was followed with a half hour nap.

And actually got some writing done! A few times every day, I sat down to the computer and plotted out a script. 

In the evenings, I usually went to eat at a restaurant on the ocean and then to one of the bars for a drink or two before bed. 

I think I could have stayed a whole additional week. I did miss David quite a bit, and the puppies, of course. 

FYI - These photos are the first ones to be taken with my new iPhone. Not bad for a camera phone, I think.

&quot;Does Liking Mika Make Me a 9 Year Old Girl?&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/music/does-liking-mika-make-me-9-year-old-girl&quot;;&quot;My friend Claudio's 9-year-old daughter, Carmen, recently had a birthday party in New York City. I asked Sara if she had any information on something that might be appropriate to get her. Carmen likes Mamma Mia and Madonna. At first I thought I'd get her a Cyndi Lauper CD. Then I texted Jeff to see if he had any ideas. He was with a friend that recommended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_(singer)" target="_blank">Mika</a>'s album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Cartoon-Motion-Mika/dp/B000NA2776/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1217766359&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Life in Cartoon Motion</a>.

I checked it out on iTunes. Yes, it's appropriate for a 9 year old girl. A lot of the songs of bubble-gum pop, it's catchy, it's upbeat. And the album cover is beautiful. It was so enjoyable, I got it for myself as well.

Apparently, I'm just a 9 year old girl at heart. Who cares...some of the songs on the album are too fun to worry about such things.

&quot;Jott Has Changed My Life&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/iphone/jott-has-changed-my-life&quot;;&quot;You can expect to start seeing some entries on really cool iPhone apps. The latest and greatest one is Jott (http://jott.com). It's a lot more than an iPhone app, but that's how I discovered it.
<!--break-->
I had started using the built-in "Notes" application for the iPhone. When I tried to transfer the notes I had taken to my computer, I discovered that you couldn't. Apple hadn't built that yet. Grrr. So I started looking for a new application for taking simple notes.

Jott seemed to fit the bill and had some sort of voice recording feature, so I downloaded it and started playing around. It turns out that it's a lot more than just taking notes. It's a speech-to-text application, but instead of loading a ton of software on your computer and bogging down your system, it sends the piece of recording to its servers, translates, and sends you back the results. It keeps their applications small and lightweight.

I tested it out and it was pretty accurate. When I decided to really push it by speaking however I felt like, it started having problems. It's definitely best to speak clearly and a little slowly. If you come across a word that you think it wouldn't know (like a proper noun), you can say the word and then spell it out. It figures out what you're doing and spells the word correctly. 

Now comes the cool part. They have a toll free number that you can call. From that number, you can do more than just take notes. You can send a text message to someone, you can send an email to someone, you can add items to any type of list you can think of, you can add events to your Google calendar, and much more. It's incredible. 

I set up a "To Do" list for myself. David uses it all the time if there's something he wants me to take care of. He calls the number, it asks "What would you like to Jott?" 

He says "To Do List"

It says "Okay"

And then he says something like "Call Kaback K-A-B-A-C-K to schedule repair of air conditioner".

Within 10 minutes, it shows up on my iPhone's to-do list.

I also set up a list for groceries. So if there's something I need to get, I call the number, say "Grocery" and then the name of the item. When I go shopping, I have the list on my iPhone and can check off items as I shop. It's pretty cool.

They also have a website so I can easily type lists of items if I want - as opposed to calling the number.

We've used it for our shared Google Calendar. David set up a day that we are going to Philadelphia to visit his family. I called the toll free number, said "Casa de Gogo" (which is the name of our shared Google calendar), and said "August 31st, Reich R-E-I-C-H Pool Party". Done.

You can send email as well through Jott, but so far I haven't done that. There are some things that require a personal touch.&quot;;&quot;1218279102&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Tomato Sauce w/Meatballs&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/main-ingredient/pasta/tomato-sauce-wmeatballs&quot;;&quot;The old family puh-sgetti and meatballs recipe. What kind of Italian would I be if I didn't have this on my site?
<!--break-->
Servings: Feed 4 happily

<strong>The Sauce</strong>

1 medium onion chopped
1 clove garlic (minced)
1 tablespoon oil
56 oz cans crushed tomatoes
1 small can tomato paste
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
1 bay leaf
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
½ cup fresh basil, chopped

Heat the olive in a skillet or sautee pan. Add the chopped onion. Cook until the onions turn clear, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Be careful to not let the garlic brown. Add the tomato paste and cook another minute. Add the crushed tomatoes and bring everything to a light boil.

If you have a slow cooker, put the tomato/onion mixture in the slow cooker and add the remaining ingredients. Otherwise, add the remaining ingredients and turn the heat to the lowest possible setting. Cook for as long as you can, at least two hours, stirring occasionally.

<strong>The Meatballs</strong>

1 lb ground meat (you may want to use half hamburger and half sausage)
1 egg
1 cup breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons parsley
1 clove garlic (minced)
½ teaspoon oregano
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon black pepper

Form the meat into small balls. Brown the meatballs in olive oil. Add them to the tomato sauce and simmer. The longer, the better.

&quot;Some changes to the site...&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/technology/some-changes-site&quot;;&quot;I've been steadily making changes to the site. This weekend I had some time to really go to town. It seems like I really didn't do all that much - I don't know where the time goes when I program. I suppose it's because I use my own site as a test ground for changes, so when I work on something, I may spend hours going down a path that I realize was not the right way to go. I chalk it all up to learning experiences.
<!--break-->

Anyway, here's the list of recent additions:
<ul>
<li>Add a twitter feed. This makes it easy for me to send little snippets about my day to the site.
<li>Add a search box to every page.
<li>Changed the definitions for recipes so I can more easily migrate content from my old site over.
<li>Added boxes on the right for "Recipes by Dish" and "Recipes by Ingredient".
<li>Added a "similar posts" box.
<li>Cleaned up some layout and display issues.
<li>Optimized the URLs for search engines
<li>Installed sitemaps and submitted them to the major search engines
</ul>

Now that I wrote that all down, it does some like a lot for one weekend.

Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl.

In a large bowl, cream the sugar and cream cheese together. One at a time, beat in the eggs, mixing well and scraping down the bowl after each addition. Mix in the mashed bananas until well combined. Stir in the walnuts or pecans. Add the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Don't overmix or be concerned about a few small lumps. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pans.

Bake until a wooden skewer comes out clean and the batter in the cracks on the top of the breads looks cooked, about 1 hour.

Transfer to a wire cooling rack and cool in the pans for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the inside of the pans to loosen the loaves. Takes the loaves out of the pan using a kitchen towel, and let cool on a rack completely.

Servings: Makes 1 braided loaf

Combine in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer and let stand until the yeast is dissolved, about 5 minutes:
1 package (2¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast
½ cup warm (105º to 115º F) water

Add:

½ cup all-purpose flour
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
2 egg yolks, lightly beaten
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons sugar
1¼ teaspoons salt

Mix by hand or on low speed until thoroughly blended. Gradually stir in:

2½ cups bread flour

Knead for about 8 minutes by hand or with the dough hook on low to medium speed until the dough is smooth and elastic and no longer sticks to your hands or the bowl. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and turn it over once to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place (75º to 80ºF) until doubled in volume, 1 to 1½ hours. Punch the dough down, knead briefly, and refrigerate covered until it has again nearly doubled in volume (a three-quarter rise is sufficient), 4 to 12 hours. The dough is now ready to be shaped.

Weigh and divide the dough equally into 3 pieces. On an unfloured work surface, roll into balls and let rest, loosely covered with plastic wrap, for 10 minutes. Grease a baking sheet and sprinkle it with cornmeal. Roll each ball into a 13- to 14-inch-long rope, and 1½ inches think and slightly tapered at the ends. Dust the three ropes with rye flour so they will be more distinctly separated. Place the 3 dough ropes side by side and pinch the top ends together. Lift the left dough rope and place it between the right and middle ropes. Lift the right rope and place it between the left and middle ropes, then the left rope between the right and middles ropes and so on until you reach the ends. Tuck both ends of the braid underneath the loaf and set it on the baking sheet. Whisk together and brush over the top of the loaf:

1 egg
Pinch of salt

Loosely cover the braid with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until not quite doubled, about 45 minutes.

Preheat the over to 375ºF. Brush the loaf again with egg wash. If desired, sprinkle with:

1 tablespoon poppy or sesame seeds

Bake until the crust is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely on a rack.

Combine the yeast, sugar, salt, water, milk, sour cream, egg yolks, lemon juice, lemon rind and extracts together in another bowl, then stir into the flour mixture, adding enough of the remaining 1 cup all-purpose flour as needed to form a soft dough.

Knead dough several minutes on a lightly floured work surface, then place in a well-greased bowl, turning dough over once, and cover. Refrigerate a minimum of 4 hours to overnight.

Gently deflate dough. On a lightly floured work surface, roll dough into a large, thin rectangle.

Combine ingredients for filling and sprinkle evenly over dough. Roll up (as for jelly roll) and place in a well-greased tube pan.

½ cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar, packed

1½ cups egg whites (11 to 12)
1½ cups sifted confectioner's sugar
1 cup sifted cake flour
¼ teaspoon salt
1½ teaspoons cream of tartar
1 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

About 1 hour before baking the cake, place the cold egg whites in the bowl of a mixer. Bring the eggs to approximately 60º.

Preheat the oven to 350º. Have a clean, ungreased, 10 inch tube pan.

Sift the confectioner's sugar, sifted cake flour, and salt onto a piece of waxed paper.

Whip the egg whites on low speed until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and increase the speed to medium. Whip just until soft peaks form. Continue whipping and gradually add the granulated sugar in a steady stream until the egg whites thicken and form soft, droopy white peaks. Add the vanilla.

Sprinkle one quarter of the flour mixture over the whites, and with a rubber spatula, fold into the whites. Repeat this process three more times. Gently pour the batter into the tube pan.

Bake until the top is golden and springs back gently when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean: 40 to 45 minutes.

Invert the cake onto the neck of a bottle or funnel. Cool completely in the pan - 2 to 3 hours.

To remove the cake, run a knife through the inside of the pan to loosen the cake from the edges. Invert the cake onto a plate and remove the bottom.

&quot;Banana-Strawberry Layer Cake&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/desserts/banana-strawberry-layer-cake&quot;;&quot;This is one dessert that I have a hard time keeping my hands off of when I make it. I think I could finish it off by myself. It's essential that the bananas are fully or overly ripe and the strawberries are at the hieght of the season.
<!--break-->

Servings: One two-layer 9-inch cake

<strong>Banana Cake</strong>

¾ cup unsalted butter at room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas
2 cups cake flour
¾ teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon salt
⅓ cup full-fat sour cream

Preheat the oven to 350°. Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch round cake pans and tap out the excess flour.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. One at a time, beating well and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition, add the eggs. Add the vanilla and bananas. Scrape down the bowl again and beat.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add half the dry ingredients to the banana batter and mix just enough to moisten the dry ingredients. Add the sour cream to the batter. Add the remaining dry mixture. Mix just until the batter is evenly mixed. Add the batter to the two pans and smooth the tops.

Set the pans in the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. A wooden skewer should come out clean. Cool the cakes in the pans for 7 minutes after baking, then set on a rack and cool completely.

<strong>Cream Cheese Frosting</strong>

16 oz cream cheese
½ cup unsalted butter at room temperature
1 package (500 grams) confectioner's sugar
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1½ teaspoons vanilla extract

Prepare the cream cheese frosting by mixing the cream cheese and butter on high speed until light and fluffy.

Sift in the powdered sugar. Mix on low speed until evenly blended. The less mixing, the better. Cover and refrigerate the icing for 15 - 30 minutes to help it firm up.

<strong>Final Assembly</strong>

1 quart strawberries, washed and dried

Add a dab of icing to the center of a cake circle. Add one of the cake layers. Starting with a generous amount of icing, cover the top of the first cake layer. But everything back in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up.

Remove 10 to 12 small, pretty strawberries and one large one. With the remaining berries, hull them, and cut them in thirds horizontally. Add the strawberry layers to the top of the iced cake layer. Do not overlap slices. Add the second cake layer and press down slightly so that the icing can adhere to the second cake layer. Ice the cake with the remaining cream cheese icing. Put everything back in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.

Just before serving the cake, take the reserved small strawberries. Arrange the small strawberries around the edge of the cake. Take the large strawberry and make thin slices vertically from the hull to almost the stem. You should be able to fan out the slices so that the berry remains intact. Place the strawberry in the center of the cake and serve.

&quot;Brownie Puddle Tart&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/desserts/brownie-puddle-tart&quot;;&quot;<!--break-->
Servings: One 9½ inch tart

<strong>The Brownie</strong>

1 cup chopped pecans
14 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 oz high quality bittersweet chocolate
½ cup + 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa
1 cup + 3 tablespoons sugar
3 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
3 oz cream cheese
½ cup all purpose flour
a pinch of salt

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325º.

Line the bottom of a 9½ inch tart pan with parchment paper. Spray the insides of the pan with non-stick spray.

Place the pecans on a cookie sheet and toast them for approximately 10 minutes. Cool completely.

In a double boiler over low heat, melt the chocolate and butter stirring occasionally.

Beat the cocoa, then the sugar, into the chocolate mixture until completely incorporated. Beat in the eggs and the vanilla. Beat in the cream cheese. Be sure to scrape down the bowl occasionally to make sure that all ingredients are thoroughly mixed.

Stir in the flour and salt and mix only until the flour is moistened. Stir in the nuts.

Place the tart pan on a cookie sheet to catch any leaks. Pour the ingredients into the tart pan and spread it evenly.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the batter is set. A toothpick inserted one inch from the side should come out clean.

While the brownie is baking, prepare the ganache.

<strong>The Ganache</strong>

2 oz coarsely chopped bittersweet chocolate
⅓ cup heavy cream

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or on very low heat in the microwave.

Mix the cream and chocolate until smooth.

As soon as the brownie comes out of the oven, grease the end of a wooden spoon, and insert it into the brownie at one inch intervals. Twist is slightly as you insert it into the brownie and go all the way to the bottom. You should end up with about 25 holes in the brownie.

Fill a reclosable freezer bag with the ganache and cut off a small portion of one of the bottom corners. Fill the holes with the ganache.

Let the brownie cool completely before attempting to unmold the tart.

Servings: Makes 1 round layer, 9 or 10 inches in diameter by 2 inches deep

⅓ cup cake flour
⅓ cup cornstarch
¼ cup alkalized (Dutch process) cocoa powder
3 large eggs plus 3 large egg yolks
¾ cup sugar
Pinch salt

One 9 or 10 x 2-inch round layer pan, or a 9-inch springform pan, buttered and the bottom lined with a disk of parchment or wax paper.

Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350°.

Sift together the cake flour, cornstarch, and cocoa through a fine?meshed strainer over a piece of wax paper to break up any small lumps in the cocoa. Set sifted ingredients aside with the strainer.

Whisk together the eggs, yolks, sugar, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and continue whisking gently until the mixture is lukewarm, about 100°. This should take only a minute or two.

Whip with the electric mixer on high speed until the mixture is cooled and increased in volume, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Remove bowl from mixer and sift in dry ingredients, in three additions, gently folding each third in with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread the top even with a spatula.

Bake the layer about 30 minutes, until it is well risen and the center is firm to the touch.

If necessary, loosen the layer from the side of the pan with a small knife or spatula and invert the cake onto a rack. Place another rack on the cake and invert again. Remove the top rack, so that the layer cools right side up, still on the paper.

To make the glaze, bring the cream to a boil, then remove from the heat. Add the chocolate, allow to stand 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Strain into a bowl and cool to room temperature.

<strong>Assemble the cake</strong>

One 9-inch round Chocolate Genoise, baked and cooled

To assemble, slice cake into three horizontal layers and place one on a cardboard or springform base. Sprinkle layer with syrup and spread with half the orange filling. Spread with a third of the ganache filling. Repeat with remaining layers, syrup, marmalade, and ganache filling. Spread the outside of the cake with the remaining ganache but reserve enough to pipe some rosettes on the outside of the cake. Chill cake to set.

Place the chilled cake on a rack over a roasting pan and pour the glaze over it, starting in center of cake and pouring outward in larger and larger circles to the edge, ending at top edge. Let the glaze run down and cover the sides of the cake. Allow to stand about 5 minutes to set glaze. Use a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip to pipe rosettes around top edge of cake. To keep the glaze shiny, avoid refrigerating the cake.

<strong>The Crumb Crust</strong>

1 ½ cups or 7 oz graham cracker or other dry cookie crumbs (I prefer dry ginger cookies)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
¼ cup sugar

Press firmly into an unbuttered 9-inch pie pan. Refrigerate until ready to use.

<strong>Pie Filling</strong>

½ cup fresh lime juice
4 large egg yolks
14 oz sweetened condensed milk
Pinch of salt

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350º.

Since key limes are so small and hard to squeeze, I quarter key limes and squeeze each lime quarter with a garlic press. It takes about 12 key limes to get enough juice. Be sure to use the ones you zested.

Combine the yolks and lime zest and beat on high speed until well mixed and slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Add the condensed milk and beat well. Add the lime juice and salt and beat again. Pour into the pie shell.

Bake the pie on a baking sheet until the filling looks firm when the pie is gently shaken, 15 to 17 minutes. Transfer the pie to a wire cooling rack and cool completely.

<strong>Whip Cream Topping</strong>

1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Just before serving, make the whip cream topping. Beat the cream with the sugar and vanilla on high speed until stiff peaks form. Decorate the pie with the whip cream topping.

<strong>Toffee Crunch</strong>

1½ cups sugar
¼ cup brewed coffee (or espresso)
¼ light corn syrup
3 teaspoons baking soda.

Combine the sugar, coffee and corn syrup in a large pot. The contents will bubble up considerably, so use as big a pot as you can while being able to get an accurate read on the temperature.

Bring it to a boil over med-high heat. Without stirring, continue to cook the coffee-caramel to 310º.

Remove from the heat, and add in the baking soda. The mixture will foam quite a bit. Keep stirring. Once it stops foaming (about a minute), immediately pour the mixture onto a non-greased cookie sheet with sides. Let it cool completely.

When the coffee mixture is cool, place it in a plastic bag and break into smaller pieces.

<strong>Red Velvet Cake</strong>

Vegetable oil for the pans
2½ cups all-purpose flour
1½ cups sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon fine salt
1 teaspoon cocoa powder
1½ cups vegetable oil
1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
2 large eggs, at room temperature
2 tablespoons red food coloring (1 ounce)
1 teaspoon white distilled vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Cream Cheese Frosting, recipe follows
Crushed pecans, for garnish (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350° F. Lightly oil and flour 3 (9 by 1 1/2-inch round) cake pans.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder. In another large bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla.

Using a standing mixer, mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined and a smooth batter is formed.

Divide the cake batter evenly among the prepared cake pans. Place the pans in the oven evenly spaced apart. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through the cooking, until the cake pulls away from the side of the pans, and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans. One at a time, invert the cakes onto a plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up. Let cool completely.

Frost the cake. Place 1 layer, rounded-side down, in the middle of a rotating cake stand. Using a palette knife or offset spatula spread some of the cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. (Spread enough frosting to make a¼ to 1/2-inch layer.) Carefully set another layer on top, rounded-side down, and repeat. Top with the remaining layer and cover the entire cake with the remaining frosting. Sprinkle the top with the pecans.

<strong>Cream Cheese Frosting</strong>

1 pound cream cheese, softened
4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
2 sticks unsalted butter (1 cup), softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-held electric mixer in a large bowl, mix the cream cheese, sugar, and butter on low speed until incorporated. Increase the speed to high, and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.)

Reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Add the vanilla, raise the speed to high and mix briefly until fluffy (scrape down the bowl occasionally). Store in the refrigerator until somewhat stiff, before using. May be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.

&quot;Lemonade&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/beverages/lemonade&quot;;&quot;Today's the day that I got all the recipes moved over from my old site to my new site. So let's celebrate by adding a new recipe!

This summer I've been getting into homemade lemonade. It's really easy to make and is significantly healthier than anything you could buy. And you can make a million variations, so I've had fun experimenting.
<!--break-->

8 lemons
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
2 liters unflavored seltzer
mint leaves

Take 2 of the lemons and using a vegetable peeler, peel off the zest in thick strips. Place it in a small saucepan with the sugar and water. Bring everything to a boil. Let it boil for about a minute, then turn off the heat and let the syrup marinate while you juice the lemons. The syrup will turn a little yellow and the zest will turn slightly translucent.

In a large pitcher, juice all the lemons including the two you zested.

Take the zest out of the syrup and pour it into the pitcher. Pour the two liters of seltzer water into the pitcher and give everything a quick stir.

When you serve, but a couple of sprigs of mint in the bottom of the glass and pour the lemonade over the top.

I've made a few variations: I used a grapefruit in place of two of the lemons. I've replaced two lemons with 4 limes. I've put a couple of star anise seeds in the syrup to marinate. They were all successes, but the simple lemonade is the best.

For a party, I put a splash of citron vodka in the bottom of the glass before pouring in the lemonade.

It's all good.&quot;;&quot;1218478462&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Marriage of Bette and Boo&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/theater/marriage-bette-and-boo&quot;;&quot;I saw the Roundabout Theatre's production of The Marriage of Bette and Boo. It was a great production and several days after seeing it, I'm still thinking of it quite a bit. It's one of the few plays I think I could see again and again. 

I had seen a production when I was in high school at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. I still think that production was the best you could possibly see of the play. They absolutely nailed it in every way. However, the Roundabout's production had very different goals and it achieved them, so I can't fault the Roundabout too much. Their production was less of a caricature and more of a real, grounded play. And it works both ways.

Typically, I wouldn't recommend a Christopher Durang play to too many people. They are darkly comic, sadistic, and often painful things. The Marriage of Bette and Boo is certainly no different. However, all of his other plays end in total chaos and absurdity. This one always stays so close to home that you can't escape it.

I had remembered a lot of the lines. I could recite almost entire scenes. However, once it got to the end, it all felt new. There were certain scenes I had no memory of whatsoever. I think they are the sort of concepts that someone young could simply never understand. For instance, at the end of the play, the main characters are in a hospital room and reminiscing on their lives together. After watching these characters at each other's throats the entire time, I don't think I understood when I was younger how you can look back on something like and laugh. I didn't understand how a couple could go through a divorce and still call each other during difficult emotional times. Christopher Durang is making a joke at the end by showing them laughing at what are genuinely horrific moments in his childhood. But there's something existential there as well. What are we supposed to do? Harbor resentment that these awful things had happened? Consider our lives a waste because they didn't live up to our expectations? Even if you hated the person you spent the majority of your life with, at the end, it's still the person that you went through life with. Who else are you going to turn to?

It was during this scene I could have easily burst out sobbing for the rest of the play. David and I were with two of our friends, so I had to keep my composure.

If you're in New York, I highly recommend going to see The Marriage of Bette and Boo. There are few people that would not recognize some of their family in the play. It feels good to laugh at people for whom I normally would have lost all sense of humor. And if you're willing to go on the emotional journey, the play brings one to a beautiful catharsis.&quot;;&quot;1218537921&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;

&quot;Photos from Class 1&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/photos-class-1&quot;;&quot;It took me a while to post these, but here are photos from our first photo walk. We took a stroll around Grand Central Station and the Chrysler Building. Our instructor, Emmanuel, would give us little assignments - such as "set your shutter speed to 1/250 and give me a reading as to what the aperture should be". On some assignments, he gave us all the settings and just told us to take pictures. That allowed us to see how the settings affected the quality of the photo and also to allow us to focus on composition. 

We did one exercise at a construction site. The light was catching the bright yellow equipment in an interesting way, so we tried to capture that quality. A family passed by staring at us in confusion. I heard the wife say "it's a photography class" and the husband responded with "yeah, but what the hell are they taking a picture of?"

At another point, we were right across the street from the Chrysler building. Emmanuel pointed out that the Chrysler building was reflected in the plain building across the street. The class immediately looked away from the Chrysler building and started taking photos of the reflection. A few tourists were completely baffled as to what we were taking pictures of and kept scanning the building for something interesting.

My photos from this session varied wildly from good to awful. I really wasn't happy with any of them when I got home and was dreading the critique at the next class. However, I was happy with the critique I got. I think my expectations were too high for the first class.

&quot;Photos from Class 2&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/photos-class-2&quot;;&quot;Here are photos from our second photo walk. This walk was done in and around Bryant Park. The clouds were wreaking havoc with our settings, so we had to be nimble - and many of my photos came out too dark. 

We spent a lot of time working on portraiture in real light situations. Emmanuel showed us various lighting techniques, such as using a reflector. We also experimented with using slow shutter speeds around a fast moving subject for effect.

After the formal part of our class, we were given time to wander around the park and take candid shots. That is not an easy task. I'm not very fast with the camera yet, and people get very uncomfortable if they see you staring a camera at them for a good 30 seconds. A lot of us developed a technique in which we would aim the camera just to the side of the subject, get the settings right, and then quickly point at the subject and take the shot. 

I was very happy with a lot of these photos. I even caught a picture of Tom Sproat smiling! That's more rare than any National Geographic nature shot.

&quot;Photos from Class 3&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/photos-class-3&quot;;&quot;This week was tough. We had a guest teacher - someone whose name I can't remember. He is a famous street photographer. He gave us his general philosophy about photography and especially street photography. For instance, he suggested that once we feel like we have the shot, step into it the shot by taking a step 1 - 2 feet forward. It makes a big difference. All of a sudden, you feel close to your subject.

Then we went to Times Square to take street shots. I found a young couple making out and decided to take a shot, I had everything ready, then decided to take a big step forward. All of a sudden they stopped making out a looked at me like I was crazy. I hadn't gauged the distance between us very well and I was standing literally right next to them. I couldn't take a shot. I sheepishly left.

At another point, I was trying to take a purposely blurry shot of people passing in front of a theater. I was calmly waiting with the camera up to my face for enough people to pass. It seemed like fewer and fewer people were passing by. Then I lowered my camera and realized that tourists had lined up outside of my shot thinking they didn't want to interrupt my photo. I said "thank you" and everyone started passing by again. This time I waited with my camera down, and when enough people were passing by, I quickly got my shot.

It's really hard to take photos in Times Square. There's just too much activity to single out something. I thought I had taken some good photos, but when I got back home I found that most of them were unusable.

There's also one photo of some lighting experiments we did in class.

&quot;Photos from Class 4&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/photos-class-4&quot;;&quot;For our final class, we went mostly indoors. We went to the apartment of one of the class members for some experiments in indoor portrait work and then some night shots from her balcony.

I didn't come up with any great shots from this class, though I took the most photos from this class out of any of the others. Especially with the night shots, it was hard to determine how the shot was going to turn out. So there was a lot of trial and error.

&quot;The Wrong Losers&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/project-runway/wrong-losers&quot;;&quot;What is going on with the judges for this season of Project Runway? This is the second week in a row where they sent the wrong person home. 

Last week they sent Emily home with her "colorfully exploding breasts" dress. I understand that it wasn't great, but I thought Keith's dress was hideous - no shape, no skill in execution, no real design. And Emily said as much during her exit interview. She knew that her dress was not the real losing dress.

Then this week they sent Kelly home. How can that be? I agree, the outfit was awful. But Blayne's was just as bad and he had a terrible attitude. Every week I think that his 15 minutes of fame are over and he manages to squeak by again. I hope he doesn't end up being the one that clearly doesn't deserve to be in the final three but somehow ends up there anyway.

I've noticed that you can survive a bad week by mouthing off to the judges. Santino got through a couple of challenges that he clearly lost by refusing to admit that there was anything wrong with his outfit. Blayne squeaked by using the same technique.

I think we've entered the phase of the competition where the people that may have wowed me in the first couple of episodes are not able to keep up. And I feel like I have several designers now that I would happily see go.&quot;;&quot;1218723823&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Dangers of Eating Healthy&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/food/dangers-eating-healthy&quot;;&quot;This summer, I've been slowly cleaning up my diet. 

It started a few months ago when my friend, Sara, and I started eating at Pure Food and Wine about once a week (we plan on eating there once a week, but it probably averages out to every other week). For those of you who don't know, Pure makes solely raw, vegan food. No meat, no dairy, no wheat, no soy, no rice, no cooking anything above a particular temperature. I always love it when I tell people about it and they respond with "What's left?". Uh...fruits, vegetables, nuts, etc.

And it's delicious. And not "health food" delicious, but really delicious.

The first few times we went there, I would look forward to it every time I went. Then after a couple of months, it started happening that the morning of our Pure date I would think "Boy, I could really go for hamburger today. I wish we had planned lunch at Pure for tomorrow." I didn't give it much credence, I just went away. It turns out, that's the part that really needed to happen. I think that was when my brain started re-patterning, because the craving for junk food got replaced "I had healthier food and I feel a lot better."

Shortly after that, David and I went to our favorite sandwich shop for lunch. I realized that the things I loved about their sandwiches were the vegetables, cheese (I still love cheese), and their herbal mayo. So I got a veggie sandwich. David asked me if I was detoxing. I said that I honestly crave the veggie sandwich and didn't want the meat. And it was great. I haven't ordered a sandwich there with meat for a while now.

I started making more raw food at home. I started making my own almond milk. The odd thing is, at no point did I miss the old alternatives. Every now and then, I would try the old version of something (like milk in a protein shake) and it would taste "off". It would make me feel heavy and dull-headed.

I should say that I'm still eating meat. I'm still having dairy and I'm still having coffee. I'm still eating sugar and lots of other processed foods. If I get a craving for something, I make no bones about having it. I have no rules about what I will and won't eat. I'm just becoming more and more aware of how I feel afterwards - and unhealthy foods have started dropping by the wayside. 

The other night, I was home by myself for dinner. That was usually the night I would order barbecue - so I did. I felt LOUSY. I couldn't even finish it. I got cranky. I had a hard time sleeping. And the next morning, my body was doing it's best to evacuate everything in my system. 

Geez. Was my system really used to this kind of food at one point? It's a little frightening. 

Yesterday, I had lunch at Pure and stopped at the farmer's market on the way home. I made a great salad and we grilled corn and salmon for dinner. Last night I slept great and woke up earlier than usual, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. 

A little side note: I had taken a friend to Pure yesterday for his inaugural visit. I ordered a Strawberry Blond smoothie: it had strawberries, bananas, pineapple and some other delicious things. My friend ordered a ginger shot. He saw the look on my face and said "what? is that bad?" I said absolutely not, it's just kind of <em>advanced</em> for someone that's new to raw food. It cracks me up how people will go to a place like Pure and then order something that is - frankly - difficult to enjoy when the menu is full of genuinely delicious foods that are also healthy. I had a sip of his ginger shot. I had expected it to be pretty strong and intense. It was LIP-SEARINGLY STRONG! My sinuses burned from the tiny sip I had. Then he had a sip of my smoothie and the look on his face said it all. He thought he was drinking the most amazing milkshake of his life. I said "It's okay to eat healthy and enjoy yourself at the same time."

&quot;Outside View&quot;;&quot;personal/house/pre-renovation/outside-view&quot;;&quot;<p>So here we are. 218 W 15th St. Formerly the Bowery Mission Women's Home. To our east is a Catholic nursery. To our west is a building similar to ours, but broken into a million tiny apartments. David said that during the demolition, several people stopped by and said how happy they were to know that the house was being used as a family residence again. I guess those Bowery Mission Women were not the best neighbors.</p>

&quot;The Ground Floor&quot;;&quot;personal/house/pre-renovation/ground-floor&quot;;&quot;<p>There is much confusion as to how the floors are numbered. The architect somewhat decided it for us by calling the first floor the ground floor and the second floor the first floor.

&quot;The New Kitchen&quot;;&quot;personal/house/post-renovation/new-kitchen&quot;;&quot;<p>Shortly after finishing the new kitchen, we saw a commercial for Martha Stewart. We were stunned to realize that we had unknowingly (I swear!) built Martha Stewart's kitchen....except we have a better countertop. But in terms of "look and feel" Martha and ourselves are in agreement. This is either very good or very bad. After spending any amount of time in the kitchen, you will be forced to agree that we nailed it. Especially on a summer day, the doors open to the backyard, everyone hanging around the island without me having to yell, "GET OUT OF MY WAY! I'M COOKING." You will soon forget you are in Manhattan. Let's take a tour through the kitchen with David, shall we?</p>

<p>There are two main lighting fixtures in the kitchen. We got both of them at aplace in Soho with hundreds of different lights. You don't buy any individual light, you point out the lights that you like and they make them from scratch for you. That way you can mix and match various styles. For instance, the lighting fixture in the store that matched the one over the island had three lights and we asked for two.</p>

</div>
<p>Appliances were a big deal. We cut corners on some items, but not on the appliances. Since David has more experience with high end appliances, he made a lot of the decisions here. The centerpiece (in my opinion) is the double convection oven. A convection oven has a fan in the back to circulate the hot air so that there are no cold spots in the oven - everything cooks evenly, cakes don't rise in the center, and everything cooks faster. It's kind of a miracle. And now we have two of them. Occassionally, I'll be making a big dinner and think, "I'll prebake the tart crust, then put in the chicken and when the chicken is done, I'll put in the...wait. I have two ovens."</p>
<p>When the kitchen was pretty much finished, I said to David, "I'm sorry that I bulldozed every decision into getting my perfect kitchen." David replied with, "What do you mean? I got everything I wanted." ACtually, the base design came from a kitchen place that we lived next door to when we had an apartment on the east side.</p>

&quot;The Creamsicle Room&quot;;&quot;personal/house/post-renovation/creamsicle-room&quot;;&quot;<p>When we first renovated the living room, we had picked out a color called "milquetoast" that was very plain beige on the swatch. By the time we got to painting the living room, we were exhausted with renovations. The painters first got paints that were the same number from a different paint manufatcurer. It came out very dark olive green. David came home and said, "wrong, wrong, wrong!" The next day he came home and they had painted a panel with the rigth color, but on the wall it came out very peachy. I didn't say anything because I figured David would tell them the color was wrong. However, the color was right and David was too tired to pick a new color. So our living room became "The Creamsicle Room".</p>

<p>Whenever we told people that we weren't sure that the color worked, the response was always "Oh, no, it works great for this room. Don't change anything." When we put in the fireplace we had to repaint and we decided that enough was enough. As soon as we started telling people that we were repainting, the response was always, "Good. This peachy-orange doesn't work."</p>

&quot;The X-Men Bathroom&quot;;&quot;personal/house/post-renovation/x-men-bathroom&quot;;&quot;<p>Somehow, somewhere, I got the idea in my head of creating a bathroom that was almost entirely composed of glass mosaic tile. I figured I could take any image, scan, and use photo editing software to transfer the image into a mosaic. David and I spent a couple of months trying to come up with a good image. I eventually decided that comic book panel would make a good image because the colors are bold, the concept is fun, and we wouldn't lose a lot of details in reducing the image quality down.</p>
<p>I started scouring old X-Men comic books that I had when I was younger. I spent some time tracking down old copies on E-Bay and then trying to find an appropriate image. I settled on a panel from the</p>
<p>Next we had to transfer that image to a workable matrix for laying out the tile. We decided to go with Carter Glass Tile which had a palette of 50 colors. I used those colors to reduce the size of the image down to what we needed to fit the bathroom. There were a lot of conversion and re-measurements. The image below shows the finished product that we used to create the mosaic. The mosaic was built in grids of 15 tiles by 15 tiles. Each square in that image represents approximately 13 inches when assembled.</p>

</div>
<p>The other nice thing about Carter Glass tile is that they sold plastic grids so you could build your own mosaics. If we hadn't found that grid, I don't think we would have been able to do the project. The grid is a big plastic waffle of 15 tiles by 15 tiles that you drop the tiles into. Once you have the grid filled, you put contact paper on the tiles and lift the tiles out. That grid then gets labelled and set aside.</p>
<p>We would zoom into each 15x15 square and then turn on one set of colors at a time, using that to build the grid. The image below shows what it looked like to us on the computer. This section is the square that makes on the right eye of the guy in the center.</p>

<p>The final image is composed 33,456 tiles. It took us about 3 weeks to make all the panels. Here are some shots of us putting together the panels.</p>

&quot;The Master Bedroom&quot;;&quot;personal/house/post-renovation/master-bedroom&quot;;&quot;<p>First, I need to remind myself what the bedroom looked like before. It's one of those things that the memory of the bedroom disappeared about a day after we tore it apart.</p>
<p>The master bedroom was one of the last great rooms in the house that still projected "women's dormitory". It had the industrial grey carpeting, a tiny door frame, and the outline of flourescent lights on the ceiling. Despite all these reasons to renovate, I think the main reason we renovated was because Gogo just did not want to be house-trained in this room. The carpet had so many layers of old carpet, carpet padding, and carpet squares that anything spilled on the floor got permanently absorbed into the floor.</p>

Everytime we prepare for renovations, I'm all excited about the final work. Then the demolition starts and I think "Was I crazy for looking forward to this? I want this OVER!"

<p>One of the not so wonderful aspects fo this renovation is that we had to do the demolition in two parts. We did the main demolitionof the two rooms on the second floor, then a week later, we had demolition on the first floor. So basically, about the time that the major dust and trauma of the first demolition was over, we got hit with a second dose. Not fun. And now whenever you come into the house, a little bit of dust and plaster falls on you from above. It's quaint, really.</p>

<p>Gogo loves the construction for some reason. She always says hello to the guys in the morning and she loves to wander into the construction zone. When they were settting up for the second round of demolition, Gogo and I were still in the bedroom. I was just finishing getting dressed. The workers were taping up all the entrances to minimize the flow of dust into the other rooms. They started to tape up the bedroom, and I heard someone say (do this in your best Brooklyn accent) "Don't tape up that room. Gogo and that guy are still in there.</p>

&quot;The Bollywood Room&quot;;&quot;personal/house/post-renovation/bollywood-room&quot;;&quot;<p>The Bollywood Room is done! This was a VERY large project. Building a home theater is certainly not anything new, but somewhere, somehow, I got it into my head that I wanted a Bollywood room. I think this is left over thoughts of wanting a Turkish room that never materialized. But in hindsight, it makes perfect sense - create a home theater celebrating the country that has the biggest film industry in the world.

David and I quickly realized that we were in over hour heads with the technology of it all. We shopped around and decided to go with AV Transformations to help us make decisions and purchase equipment. We also had to figure out how to decorate the room, and once again we thought we were in over our heads. Eventually, with help from Sis and ABC, we found ourselves not needing a special decorator. Whew!</p>

<p>First, let's talk technology. For anyone that's ever tried to plan a home theater, my heart goes out to you. I was practically paralyzed with endless decisions. The audio/visual knowledge that you have to accumulate to make a simple decision is staggering. I constantly changed my mind as to what we wanted. David originally wanted a plasma screen, but I convinced him that front projection is the way to go. We are DEFINITELY happy with the quality of the system. I won't go into all the details of the system. We got a JVC D-ILA projector since it is supposed to match real-life color most accurately. We went with a DENON receiver and DVD player and a 5.1 surround sound system. Yes, it's all as impressive as you would want it to be. And we had a gazillion cables run through the walls.</p>

</div>
<p>Now let's talk design. David and I went to look at furniture and fabric samples several times with no luck. I liked silk designs - he said no silk because it stained too easily. I showed him busy patterns - he didn't like busy. We were going nowhere. Then my sister came to visit and while I was at work, the two of them went to ABC. David called me all excited about the silk paisley pattern that they picked out. I was baffled, but ultimately happy that my sister convinced him where I had failed. And everything is uber-comfortable.</p>

<p>Now on to lighting. This was a bit of a sopa opera. We got a Morrocan-style chandelier a few months ago for the Turkish room. We thought it would go well in the Bollywood room, so David spent a couple of hours moving it. After a couple of weeks, we realized it didn't go, and David moved it back up stairs. On a trip to ABC, before we had planned anything in the room, we got four lights. Two of them are smaller, pomegranate-shaped lights that we thought would go near the screen on each side, and two larger chandeliers. And best of all: they were CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!!! At one point we thought that we were being too extravagant getting four lamps, but at the prices that we got for them, we would have been fools to not grab them while we had the chance. They are nice, but we later saw the PERFECT chandelier and it actually goes well with the ones we already bought.</p>

<p>When we finished the room, but up new lights, etc, my friend Sara came to visit and her first comment hit me to the core with my greatest fear: It Was Too Tasteful. So the next weekend, I went and got some artwork for the walls, a new window topper, and some more pillows. It's getting closer in that it's cluttered to start to feel authentic. I'm sure we will eventually get it cluttered to the point of offensive - at which point I'll be REALLY happy.</p>

&quot;The Day the Lights Went Out in Manhattan&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/blackout/day-lights-went-out-manhattan&quot;;&quot;In August of 2004, there was a blackout on much of the Eastern seaboard of the United States. We were in Manhattan when it hit. At first it was a bit exciting, but as the evening approached and we realized we'd have to go through a hot August night without even a fan, I lost my taste for this little adventure.

&quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Manhattan&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/night-lights-went-out-manhattan&quot;;&quot;<p>What was quite exciting and novel slowly descended into hell by night. It's extremely disorienting to walk around New York City with absolutely no lights on at all. Even after living through it, I can't imagine New York without lights. David thought I was crazy, but I took a brief walk with Gogo after the sun went down. You could hear people all around, and you could see flashlights, but you couldn't see anyone. Gogo was very unnerved.</p>
<p>The night was like a Carribean island. People had brought makeshift drums out on to the street to play music and dance. We tried to read by candle light, but it turns out that candle light is pretty inadequate for reading. We spent most of the evening just lying on the sofa and listening to the handheld radio for news. It was unbelieveably hot.</p>

<p>I went to bad that night expecting to hear the electricity to go on at any minute. I was looking forward to the bright lights, loud radio, and most importantly...THE AIR CONDITIONING! Imagine my disappointment when I woke up at 8 the next morning to the same stultifying heat and humidity in sweat soaked sheets.</p>

<p>New York had enjoyed the novelty of the blackout the night before. The thought of a second night of a blackout had everyone pissed and grumpy. Chelsea was one of the last neighborhoods to get their electricity back. David, Gogo, and I were going to go for YET ANOTHER walk when the electricity finally returned. The news had told us not to turn air conditioning on right away. We decided not to follow that advice.</p>&quot;;&quot;1091336400&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;A Trip to Ithaca&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/trip-ithaca&quot;;&quot;David and I drove to Ithaca, NY on Monday to help Sis and Lorenz move in. They had not even been here 24 hours by the time we arrived, so it was a chance to catch the two of them before they had settled in. Sis still had a few large pieces of luggage in the car and could not figure out how to get the orange U-Haul straps off the car, so almost immediately after hugs and hellos, we went to work.

Her apartment is nicer than I had expected. It's spacious - considering that's only the two of them for most of the year. Lorenz has a great bedroom. There were a number of things to fix around the apartment and Sis had already started a list. After arranging some things, we put Lorenz in the stroller and headed to the downtown area for dinner.

Ithaca is a very crunchy town. It wasn't until day two here that I found out THE Moosewood Restaurant was founded here. We passed several organic grocers and vegan restaurants. The Ithaca Commons (which is a string of stores and pubs where cars are not allowed) is filled with acoustic musical groups and hacky sack players. David had never heard of hacky sack to which Sis and I expressed reluctant belief.

We found a Mexican restaurant with outdoor seating. The meal was cut short by a passing downpour - but by that time, all I had to do was chug my margarita and run for cover.

The second day, we decided to tackle the list of things to fix around the apartment. Sis had a pretty lengthy list that covered things like utensils (she had forgot to bring knives, forks, and spoons), bed rails for Lorenz, curtains and curtain rods, etc. There is a Target in town. David and I had never been in a Target (to which Sis expressed reluctant belief). I have to admit, Target was pretty amazing. The choices of things to get were actually pretty nice and the prices were shockingly low. Sis wanted to get a $99 sofa, but when she saw me sit in it, she realized it was probably too small. So instead we got a sofa cover for existing large and mildew-smelling sofa.

We got some items for Lorenz as well - a Play-doh set and a Spider-Man lunchbox and thermos.

After the Target run, we took Sis to the "other" daycare center. Sis had gotten accepted, but she had decided to go with another daycare center and was racked with indecision. We took her there so she could check it out. It was a more modern daycare, filled with plastic toys and efficiency. Although everyone was very nice and they had a huge waiting list that Sis had somehow gotten around, Sis felt like she had made the right decision taking Lorenz to <a href="http://www.namastemontessorischool.com/" target="_blank">Namaste Montessori</a> instead - which is more in the country, uses only toys made of wood and metal, and has other vegetarian kids.

Next, we took sometime to explore the campus. It's up on a hill, over-looking the rest of Ithaca. There's a beautiful river cutting through campus so there are waterfalls and bridges. Sis got us some cool Cornell fashions since today was a bit breezier than we had expected. We saw the building with her office, which looked to be one of the nicer and more character-driven buildings (at least form the outside).

After that we went unloaded the car. I put on the bed rails for Lorenz, David hung up the new curtains. At one point, David said that he felt like he was hanging up curtains for his theoretical daughter. I asked him what he meant and he said "I'm at the age where if I had gotten married and had kids, they would be at the age right now where they'd be going off to college and I'd be here hanging up their curtains in their dorm room."

I told him that we were happy to satisfy the needs of his biological clock.

We drove to Namaste Montessori to pick up Lorenz. The school was very small and cute. The teachers all seemed extremely kind and competent. I could see that Lorenz was in good hands. We drove to the nearby Buttermilk Falls and did a bit of hiking around. Lorenz was in a crabby mood from being both tired and hungry, so we skipped the next waterfall and went for dinner.

We couldn't get into Moosewood, so we went for Japanese instead. Lorenz was a lot more pleasant to deal with after he got some food. And we got cold sake to share - making jokes that we were going to change from uncles to drunkles.

After dinner, we took them home (Lorenz LOVED his Spider-Man lunchbox) and went back to the hotel to crash.

Although I am the Capricorn of the family, I fell like my sister is the true sea-goat. The idea of the Capricorn is that with the front of a goat and the tail of a fish, it stubbornly refuses to accept its limitations and climbs mountains regardless of its lack of hind legs. How my sister could pack up her son and just enough items to get by, drive across the country to rent an apartment she'd never seen in a new town is beyond me. It's of course a good career choice, but it's quite a sacrifice and not an easy road. Things will be easier when her husband Mark comes to visit but that's several months away. I don't think I could ever make the choice that she did. 

David wins the husband, brother-in-law, and uncle of the year award for taking care of Sis. And I told him as much. &quot;;&quot;1219234383&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The New York City Waterfalls&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/new-york-city-waterfalls&quot;;&quot;Last weekend was one of those perfect summer days in NYC - blue skies, billowy clouds that show off every last detail, and not too sweltering. Mr. R and Benji were in town, so I asked them if they wanted to go on a short cruise to see the <a href="http://www.nycwaterfalls.org/" target="_blank">NYC Waterfalls</a>. The answer was yes and David agreed.

We headed down to South Street Seaport to get tickets from one of the cruises that leaves from down there. Apparently, we were one of several hundred other people that had the same idea. The lines were long and didn't move. We quickly bagged the idea of the cruise and decided to just look at the waterfalls from afar, which still ended up being a good idea.

I think one's first reaction to the waterfalls is "meh". But the more you look at them, the more it helps you appreciate the fact that New York is an island with all of these great waterways with their own life. The one at the Brooklyn Bridge seemed to be the best because the bridge blocks the wind. The other two that we could see were being blown so strongly that it was more of a mist-producer than a waterfall.

After the viewing we went for ice cream and then to the TKTS booth, where Benji and Mr. R got tickets to The Marriage of Bette and Boo.

&quot;A Trip to Ithaca: Part 2&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/ithaca-ny/trip-ithaca-part-2&quot;;&quot;So...I was just in Ithaca. But Mom flew out pretty much right after I left to help take care of Lorenz. It would have been a shame that Mom had traveled all that way and we wouldn't have been able to see each other - so I packed a bag and drove to Ithaca again. At least this time I knew the scenic road to take. And since David wasn't with me this time, I could crank up the music and shout/sing to my heart's content.

A lot of time was spent just hanging out at the house. The second day I was there, Mom and Lorenz and I drove around Cayuga lake, stopping at wineries and other local sites. It was stunningly beautiful. At one stop, Lorenz saw a necklace with wine corks and fake grapes. He went <em>bonkers</em> for that necklace. I tried to take some photos, but they didn't capture his squealing glee and ecstasy that came from the necklace. We almost bought it. We decided for 8 bucks, it was worth the entertainment value. But he lost interest in about 30 seconds so we skipped it.


On the morning of the day I left, we all went to the Ithaca Farmer's Market. There was a ton of fresh produce, some homemade pastries (like apple-poppy seed strudel), musicians and all sorts of modern hippie goodness. Honestly, Ithaca is the sort of town I think I could settle into.

&quot;Gogo In the Beginning&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/gogo-beginning&quot;;&quot;<p>Shortly after Dorian died, I went on the American Kennel Club website and started poking around. I hadn't even thought of getting another dog. However, I noticed that it eased the pain to look at pictures of other dogs and think that maybe someday, in the future, I would get a new dog. At the time, I felt like I let months pass before I started researching breeds with the intention of another dog. In hindsight, it was more like a week.</p>

<p>David and I had decided that we wanted to get a puppy. And if we were to get a puppy, we would either have to know someone whose dog we liked that was having a litter or we would have to get a breeder. Considering that we wanted to take the new dog to play with kids, we had to know that the dog we were getting was friendly. So I started systematically going through the AKC website and researching breeds.</p>
<p>I can't even remember now what my original attraction was to Canaan Dogs. I suppose it was the easy grooming, the good health records, the "dogly" disposition and the intelligence. So I contacted Parker Flowers (I got his name from the <a href="http://www.cdca.org">CDCA</a> as a contact in Rhode Island) and he suggested I come out to Renee's house to meet her recently born litter and her gang of adult Canaan Dogs.</p>

<p>Renee is a proud owner (most of the time) of many Canaan Dogs. You can check out her whole pack at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/RRenegadeCD/index.htm">Renegade Canaan Dogs</a>. Before I came to Renee's both she and Parker warned me about how aloof Canaan Dogs can be with strangers and that the reaction I get at the beginning is not what they're like once they get used to you.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Renee's, three of her dogs came right up to me to check me out. They said hello and hung around for a little attention. Both Parker and Renee said that this was atypical. Later, when they brought Lucy out, they mentioned that she was hormonal and may act rather strange and aloof. She came up to me wagging her tail and was very affectionate. Once again, not the usual reaction. Luckily, one of Renee's dogs, Oren, did live up to the stand-offish reputation that Parker and Renee promised.</p>
<p>She then brought out all the little furballs. They seemed to have no idea where they were. One of them would be standing in the middle of the room and would start crying for no reason. (I'm pretty sure that was Gogo). Anyway, after meeting the whole gang, the mother, and some other adults, I knew I had stumbled onto to something great, and put a deposit down on a pup.</p>

<p>Over the next several weeks, it was a matter of waiting. I was still quite sad about Dorian, and was not ready for a puppy quite yet. David was putting pressure on me to wait, because we were scheduled to get Gogo the week before we moved. Luckily, I had friends that talked me out of waiting. What is a good time to get a new puppy? Always. I thought of it as a wonderful way to break up the monotony of packing and moving. Plus, that was when our apartment was two blocks from my job, and I was hoping for a leg up (so to speak) on housetraining.</p>

<p>I did get a chance to drive out to New Jersey to meet the litter again when they were eight weeks old. At this point, we pretty much figured that I was getting Gogo. Renee had taken them all for personality tests and she seemed like the best match for me. I now know that what Renee meant by that was that Gogo was a trouble-maker. I also told Renee that we were probably going to name her Gogo. It didn't fly with Renee. Luckily, Parker was there and thought it was an appropriate name.</p>

<p>My sister drove with me out to Renee's to pick Gogo up. The ride back was fairly uneventful. When we left, Gogo started shivering for a while, but eventually calmed down. No crying. Sis is very good at comforting puppies.</p>
<p>We got home and David was there packing. We all played with Gogo and she seemed quite happy. Lots of frolicking.</p>
<p>The second day we had her, I thought I'd get her used to her crate and put her in while I went to take a shower. There was a little crying. No problem. Never let a crying dog out of a crate. The crying turned into screaming. This is difficult, but I'll be strong. The screaming turned into sounds I never heard come out of a dog before. It was the sound of a dog losing its mind. At its height, it turned into the sound of a hyena. Out of sheer panic and torture from having to hear those sounds, I let her out of her crate. Gogo wins.</p>
<p>The rest of that week, when I would leave for work, I would begin to hear her cry as I left. However, a couple of times I came home a few hours later and she was still crying. It happened once that a friend of ours was at the apartment packing and happened to call me at work. I could barely hear him from the sounds of Gogo in the background. I ran right over and she just seemed out of her mind with grief.</p>
<p>These pictures of from that first week with Gogo and the last week in our old apartment.</p>
<p>The one time Gogo's crying has worked to an advantage is the first night we tried to have her sleep in her crate. The crying started. The crying turned to screaming. Eventually, David said "I know I'm going to regret this for the next fourteen years, but..." and let Gogo out and put her on our bed. And she's been hogging the bed ever since.</p>

&quot;Gogo In the New House&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/gogo-new-house&quot;;&quot;<p>So then we moved into the new house. She spent a lot of time riding in my gym bag (finally a good use for it) on trips to and from the new house.</p>

<p>There's a small room on the second floor that we had declared Gogo's Room. It faces the street, so I figured, when she got older, she could sleep on a chair in the room and look out the window at people passing by. How quaint. Of course all she did in her room was scream and rip up the carpet. A man across the street left notes about how much she cries and was concerned about her well-being. He talked to our dog-walker, Melanie, one day and threatened to report us to the ASPCA. She explained that Gogo has her own room, bigger than a lot of other people's rooms in Manhattan. I did meet him one day, and I think he was disappointed to find out that I wasn't an ogre.</p>

<p>It was also around this time that I took Gogo to a puppy playgroup. It was sponsored by my vet for puppies under the age of 16 weeks, since puppies that young shouldn't be out on the street or going to the dog run. Everyone had their sweet little fluff balls with them. I figured that Gogo came from such a big family, that she would have no problems socializing. She sat on my lap and wouldn't move. If a puppy came up to us, she would growl and bare her teeth. Eventually, she stepped off my lap and everyone said, "Oh good, she's coming out of her shell!" They soon regretted her new found confidence as she began systematically bullying every dog there. She would run up and pounce on other puppies, corner them and nip at them, knock them over - anything to prove her superiority. Now add to this new Gogo sounds - snarling, barking, growling; when they do sound effects in movies for vicious dogs, it doesn't sound this frightening. I tried to smile and say the typical bad owner phrase - "She's usually not like this." And to be honest, she wasn't</p>

&quot;Gogo: Queen of the Jungle&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/gogo-queen-jungle&quot;;&quot;During the summer of the first renovation, Gogo's favorite spot to hang out was in the backyard. It happened once that she figured out how to get loose from the top floor and wandered through a construction zone down three flights of stairs to hang out in the backyard. From then on, we asked the guys on the ground floor if they would mind just keeping an eye on her in the backyard.

They came with Isaac and Elena (I guess they felt like having all blonde dogs). Gogo loved having everyone visit. She wanted to show off her tennis ball catching skills, but when I threw the tennis ball, Isaac appeared out of nowhere and snatched it in mid-air while Gogo was patiently waiting for it to come right to her. I gave a chew treat to Isaac after I got him to speak. I got a chew treat ready for Elena, and when I asked, "What tricks does Elena know?"</p>

<p>"Hmmm," I thought. "That's not like Renee to not teach her dogs any tricks." This was clue number one that Renee is really a softie.</p>
<p>We ordered lunch, talked and relaxed. Elena came over and put her paws in my lap for some attention. I noticed that I now smelled like dog poop. Elena was tracking it all through the house. Evan took Elena in the bckyard to clean off her paws, Renee grabbed some cleaner and started cleaning the floor, and I went to change my pants. When I got back, Renee started grilling me:"</p>
<p>"Keith, this smells like kibble poop. Are you feeding Gogo kibble?"</p>
<p>"No, Renee. I have never fed Gogo kibble."</p>
<p>"What's that bag on the shelf? That's a bag of kibble!"</p>
<p>"We've had that bag as long as you've known us. It's the same size as it always is. It's leftover from our previous dog and we keep it in case of an emergency."</p>
<p>Luckily, I remembered that Gogo had spent last weekend at a kennel, and was fed kibble. I was off the hook as far as Renee was concerned. I was actually glad that it was kibble poop, becuase we could locate it via smell to clean it up.</p>
<p>So after that adventure, I was anxious to get all the dogs out fo the house. We went for a walk along Chelsea Piers. It was then that I saw my second clue that Renee is not the tough-mama that she claims to be. ISAAC PULLS ON THE LEASH AND RENEE DOESN'T DO ANYTHIGN ABOUT IT!! How many times has she teased me for being a softie and letting Gogo walk all over me? Well, I captured it all on camera.</p>

  <div class="journalCaption">This photo is blurry because Isaac was pulling SO HARD that the camera couldn't capture it.</div>
</div>
<p>We also had a fun little adventure when we first got to the water front. There's a four foot high concrete wall between the sidewalk and the water that's 10-15 feet below. Gogo wanted to see over the edge, so I lifted her up to look at the ducks and the water. Evan said, "Up, Gogo." and all of a sudden, in one leap, Isaac jumped up and over the wall. Renee screamed and held on to his leash and was afraid that she was now strangling him as he was dangling over the edge of a concrete wall. However, on the other side of the wall, is about one foot of space that Isaac had managed to land on. Isaac is very, very lucky.</p>
<p>After that we had a relaxing walk through the piers. Renee still insisted on teaching Isaac agility commands and had him jumping over benches and walking up and down steps. I started teaching Gogo a little bit of walking and jumping. And no one taught Elena anything - she just enjoyed the day.</p>

<p>The was Gogo's first experience with post-modern decorating and she was clearly tantalized by it. As soon as she got into the room, she started running around like a crazy person. I don't know if it had anything to do with the fact that the comforter was down, but when she jumped on the bed, she crouched down and started chewing aimlessly. Go figure.</p>

&quot;And then there's Oz!&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/oz/and-then-theres-oz&quot;;&quot;<p>As fate would have it, in the summer of 2005, we adopted little Isaac, Gogo's younger half-brother. He was raised in the city, and seemed to enjoy coming back after living at Renee's place for a few weeks. We re-christened him "Oz", since that was the name we were going ot give Gogo if we had gotten a boy. We've since discovered that it's a good name for him, because he's got the courage of the Cowardly Lion, the clumsiness of the Scarecrow, and he's as squeaky as the Tin Man. He whimpers at just about everything.</p>

&quot;Trip to Oregon: Dinner at Home&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/trip-oregon-dinner-home&quot;;&quot;<p>The next day, we decided to take it easy, make a nice dinner at home, and invite friends over. We started with a look at the grill. I knew we could do much better, so Mom and I went to Home Depot and we got ourselves a new charcoal grill. And of course, there's no sense in throw the same old briquettes on a charcoal grill, so we got a starter chimney and some real wood charcoal. Man, what a difference it all makes in the flavor.</p>

<p>Mom, Dad, and I left after lunch and took a lazy drive to Lincoln City. We were hoping to stop at the Sea Gypsy motel and walk along where they fly kites, but it must not have been windy enough because we didn't see any kites. Instead, we went to the Salishan lodge and walked a nature trail to the beach. Unlike the East Coast, the Oregon coast is not a mob scene. There were a few people here and there that would pass by - some savouring the introspection that comes with a walk on the pacific coast and others gleefully saying hello, excited by the good fortune of the weather. Unlike most days on the Oregon coast, there was barely a cloud in the sky. There was a mildly cool breeze blowing off the ocean. In the distance, we saw a helicopter inspecting some boat off the coast.</p>

<p>After a stroll along the beach, we went up to Charlene's for a drink. She has a brand new house in Salishan - very serene and picturesque. There was a squirrel taking full advantage of the bird feeder on her porch. He munched on sunflower seeds the entire time we were there. Next, I went to Michael's house (also in Salishan) to check out his home theater. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to see anything in action, but I got some good advice when it's time for me to build my home theater.</p>

<p>These photos were taken during a day at our favorite beach spot, Trunk Bay. It's right next to the more exotically named "Cinnamon Bay", so I've used that name for the journal entry.

I never seem to get tired of snorkeling in St. John. Unfortuantely, these photos do not capture how much there is to see underwater.

<p>This pictures probably look like no big deal. It's a shame because I was looking at hundreds of fish of the brightest colors I had ever seen. Apparently, the magnificence of tropical fish doesn't show up when using a disposable underwater camera. Go figure.</p>

No. Is it accurate in that Sis' eyes are closed, Mark looks exhausted, and Lorenz is barely holding off a crying jag with a look of "if you don't feed me in five minutes, I'm having a meltdown"? Yes! Zoom into the photo to get the full effect. I was in Minnesota to capture some moments in Lorenz's first and second week.</p>

<p>First of all, let me say that it is exceedingly cruel to take pictures of such a newborn baby and post them. The poor guy didn't have a lot to say except "feed me". When I first arrived, he was barely opening his eyes. By the time a left, he was starting to look around and recognize me as "Not Mommy". It might have been my imagination, but his wild limb flailing seemed to be more controlled. And of course, he was starting to hold his own head up after just a week and a half! What an incredible baby!</p>

Which was pretty much always true. More shocking than seeing my sister as a mother was seeing her awake so damn much of the time! Also, I should note that when I first showed up, the dogs were not allowed on the furniture anymore. After several days of realizing that Sis and Mark would have to enforce that rule, they gave up. This picture came late in the trip when Mel and Eugene were allowed back on the furniture. And speaking of Mel and Eugene, I took some pictures of just them so they wouldn't feel left out.</para></p>

I believe that most everyone of the Everett clan was there, so it was a chance for Lorenz to see what he's in store for him. And also for Sis to see her relatives and probably get teased for being short. Unfortunately, I wasn't there, so I don't have the full scoop. But Mom sent me these pictures of Lorenz. And the other big unfortunate is that there is a great picture of Lorenz with a huge smile, but the photo came out blurry. He's about 6 or 7 weeks old in these photos.</para></p>

&quot;A Dream from Israel&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/learning/dream-israel&quot;;&quot;I'm writing this from Israel. Once again, Israel has totally knocked my socks off, but in an entirely different way. When I was here before I was primarily struck by all the religious sites. This time, I'm struck more with the people. Israelis generally have the reputation of being loud and pushy people. Yes, that's true. 

While David and I were in Tel Aviv I pointed out that not only is everyone in exceedingly good shape, the majority of the poopulation moves with a natural grace and vitality that I've never seen before in a whole country. Everyone has incredible posture and moves with athletic ease. I asked him if he thought it was the compulsory military training that did it. His theory is that first of all, it is largely an outdoor-loving people. They are active and appreciate what life has to offer. Secondly, Israeli children are not born with the same restrictions placed on them as American children. Even the teenagers run a little wild - but not wild in a malicious and loud way, but in a "do as you please" sort of way. They are treated as adults - with more than a few lectures, I'm sure - and are not controlled.

Also, most of David's colleagues that we've met here are incredibly interesting people. We met one colleague that makes his own wine in his basement. He showed us his set up in the basement where wine is pressed and stored in barrels for a year at a time. He bottles his own beer. He took us hiking in the desert. We met one of David's colleagues here in Tel Aviv. She talked about how she goes bicycling along the Mediterranean. She's taking salsa classes. None of these people seem bogged down by life or by a daily grind at all. 

Last night I had vivid dreams about it all. I was at a writer's conference at one point, and I was my usual self - reserved about showing my work and letting other people take the spotlight. At one point, an instructor came up to me and said "There are no consequences here. Be bold." - which by that he meant no <em>bad</em> consequences. So put yourself out there!

So I've made up my mind: when I get back to the states, I'm taking a class in photographic lighting (to continue by photography hobby), I'm starting swimming again, I'm sending off Betsy Stevens to publishers, I'm writing - I'm done being bogged down with limitations and exceptions. &quot;;&quot;1221536750&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;My Folding Bicycle&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/my-folding-bicycle&quot;;&quot;I came from Israel with many goals. One of them was to lose my extra weight. It's gotta go. Another goal was to enjoy more of NYC. I was definitely in a day-to-day rut. So I decided that one of the things that I could do to combat both of those was to ride a bicycle around town more often. I talked to my friend Jeff about starting to trade out days at the gym with long bike rides. We could bike along the water-front, we could bike to new neighborhoods, etc. 

Jeff has a folding bike and loved it. I decided to get one, too, so that I could keep it in the entryway for easy access. I fell in love with it almost instantaneously. Since it's a folding bike, I can take it on the subway with me. We could go to Brooklyn and bicycle around Prospect Park or Ocean Bay or wherever. And folds down small enough to fit underneath our coat rack.

&quot;The Flight to Istanbul&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/turkey/flight-istanbul&quot;;&quot;<p>First of all, let me just say that seeing pictures and reading a journal of someone else's trip is like trying to imagine what a meal tastes like by seeing pictures of the food. It doesn't even come close. Especially on a trip to Turkey and Greece - not only do the photos not do justice to the sites, but they do not capture the 99% of everything going on between the photos. To experience the Old City of Rhodes at night, for instance, you have to go there and experience it. So go there and see it because everything on this trip was worth it.</p>
<p>One more caveat - I took most of this journal on my palm-top and so there may be glitches in the hand-writing recognition software.</p>
<p>In general, we got very lucky with the weather - we only saw a few clouds in Istanbul and the rest of the trip was clear blue. Although you didn't want to hang out in the hot sun, there was usually a breeze to come through to prevent it from being too much. So, here's the journal...</p>
<p>We're about to take off from JFK. They also let us hang out in the Admiral's club and gave us each 2 drinks. David and I got upgraded but we can't sit together. We thought we could trade seats but we have two middle seats and I'm sitting between two large businessmen that would no way want to give up their aisle for middle seats. Personally, I feel a little petite in these huge new business class seats. I'm looking right now and David doesn't have anyone to his right. We may still get lucky. American Airlines has been good to us.</p>
<p>We didn't get lucky. David says that the woman that didn't move got a bad case of the hiccups as divine retribution. The flight was very calm with excellent service. Hopefully, Heathrow will have a paper showing who won Survivor last night. We are scheduled to land in a half hour.</p>

&quot;Arriving in Istanbul (formerly Constantinople (formerly Byzantium))&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/turkey/arriving-istanbul-formerly-constantinople-formerly-byzantium&quot;;&quot;<p>I think I might have just blown out the charger for my palmtop. I had it plugged in to the evil, foreign outlets and there was a puff of smoke from the charger. Hmmmm....</p>
<p>It's the Morning after arriving in Istanbul. I had a hard time sleeping. I kept dreaming about work and Survivor.</p>
<p>When we drove in from the airport I was struck at just how foreign this culture is to ours. At first, the taxi ride was playfully dangerous. After we passed an accident, it wasn't so playful. The cab driver did not speak English. He offered us a cigarette. Take that New York. The road took us around the edge of the city along the water. Istanbul is closer to a third world city than I expected. It's not as European as I was expecting, but I've not been to other Middle Eastern cities.</p>
<p>After we got settled, we called our tour guide and went to a shish kebab place for dinner. The food was very good and covered with olive oil. Most everyone here is very thin. Go figure.</p>&quot;;&quot;962946000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;First Day in Istanbul&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/turkey/first-day-istanbul&quot;;&quot;<p>The hotel is very nice. For breakfast there was a fresh honeycomb dripping honey and next to it, three different types of honey. The food in Turkey is great.</p>
<p>
         I'm finding if hard to describe my first full day in Istanbul. We went to a very old Byzantine church, 
         <a href="http://www.patriarchate.org/ecumenical_patriarchate/chapter_4/html/chora.html" target="info">The Chora Church</a>
          with beautiful mosaics on the ceilings. Our tour guide was very good and pointed out many of the intricacies of the artwork that I'm sure I would not have noticed otherwise.
      </p>

  <div class="journalCaption">This is the base of one of the pillars in the cistern - an upside down sculpture of the head of medusa.</div>
</div>
<p>
         After that we went to a Synagogue. Our Muslim tour guide taught some things to David about Hebrew and Judaism (bima vs. teva - he still insists that he's right). I was fading pretty hard at this point because I didn't sleep too well the night before. We went on to the 
         <a href="http://www.patriarchate.org/ecumenical_patriarchate/chapter_4/html/hagia_sophia.html" target="info">Hagia Sophia</a>
         , which is a church that was built on top of a Roman basilica, and then was converted to a mosque and is now a museum. If you think that the structure was a bit confused through all of its transformations, you're right. The inner courtyard had the remnants of Christian mosaics and when you walk in there are giant discs hanging from the wall with Arabic writing. Near the front are two large columns whose tops look as if they had fallen off. It turns out that they were giant candles. I can't possibly do this structure justice, so I'll stop here.
      </p>

  <div class="journalCaption">Another column in the cistern - this one with a teardrop pattern.</div>
</div>
<p>After Hagia Sophia it was more than lunchtime. Inci, our tour guide, seems to know everyone - wherever we go. I suppose she just always takes people along the same routes. Anyway, lunch was great. David and I had the chicken version of gyros and a green salad. Inci explained to us that the Greeks have stolen a lot of Turkish culture and claimed it as their own - gyros being on that list. In Turkey, it's called "doner" meat. I also had my first real Turkish coffee (In Greece, the same thing is called "Greek coffee"). It comes in the size of an espresso cup, but is very thick and muddy. It's also fairly sweet. After lunch I had no problems staying awake.</p>

<p>
         So, after lunch was the 
         <a href="http://www.eng.uml.edu/%7Esheff/iaea_98/topkapi.htm" target="info">Topkapi Palace</a>
         . This is a palace built in the 15th century that closely resembles most people's ideas (or at least my ideas) of what Istanbul must look like. It is filled with tiles and complicated geometric patterns. There are an awful lot of jewels and artifacts - such as a gold throne embedded with emeralds. Mohammed's sword was also in this palace.

  </a>
  
  <div class="journalCaption">I was trying to capture some of the detail from the ceiling of the courtyard of the Blue Mosque.</div>
</div>
<p>After that was an underground cistern in the style of a large basilica. People can walk around on platforms above the water. Some of the columns were in a special design. It finally dawned on me that I should be taking pictures. We were getting dripped on quite a bit since the whole structure was designed to collect and contain water, so David mandated that we leave.</p>

  </a>
  
  <div class="journalCaption">This is a composite of three photos of the Blue Mosque. The man you see is praying.</div>
</div>
<p>After that we took off our shoes and went into The Blue Mosque, which is Istanbul's premiere mosque. There isn't much to say, other than that it was enormous and exquisitely beautiful. I could spend a week in there taking notes on the various designs and colors. By then I was in high picture mode (not to mention high Turkish coffee mode). Hopefully, the pictures captured some of the beauty.</p>

  <div class="journalCaption">The ceiling of the Blue Mosque.</div>
</div>
<p>After that was a trip to the Grand Bazaar, which is just what you would imagine it is - a giant market selling rugs, clothes, chessboards, etc. David helped me bargain something down, but eventually I said, "that's fine" and paid for it. Both David and the Inci gave me chastising looks for giving in on the bargaining too early.</p>
<p>Next, we said farewell to the tour guide and went back to the hotel for a nap. It was about 6 o'clock at this point and we were beat. Dinner was at seven, and it was great. We had some sort of sour cherry wine for an aperitif. Dinner was some sort of grilled ground beef with cheese. It's hard to do Middle Eastern food justice with words - it's all in the spices and they are impossible to describe if you've never had them.</p>
<p>After dinner we went to a Turkish bath. Our tour guide gave us a brochure for one that we showed to the cab driver. The driver took us to a different one and when we said it's not the right one, he said, "it's okay" over and over. Since I recognized it from the guidebook, I figured it was still good, so we went in. It turned out we were the only ones there, so we got very good treatment. A Turkish bath consists of sitting in a hot steamy room, getting a vigorous massage, and then getting a loufa-like scrub followed by soap and rinsing. You sit on a marble floor while they scrub you and throw buckets of water on you. It's quite jarring but a lot of fun. Somehow, after an exhausting day and a relaxing massage and bath, David and I had trouble sleeping. Jet lag can be a terrible thing.</p>&quot;;&quot;962946000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Day of Departure (Second Day in Istanbul)&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/turkey/day-departure-second-day-istanbul&quot;;&quot;<p>
         Today was a lot less hectic. We started off going to 
         <a href="http://www.business-with-turkey.com/tourist-guide/dolmabe.htm" target="info">Dolmabahce Palace</a>
         , which is a more modern (19th century) palace for the sultan. It was much more along the lines of a typical European palace with chandeliers and grand carpets. The wooden floors were spectacular with their intricate Turkish geometry. There was also a nice art collection throughout the palace.

  <div class="journalCaption">The front entrance of the Dolme Bahce.</div>
</div>
<p>After that we went on a ferry that took us north up the Bosphorus Straits. The ride was uneventful but relaxing and had a group of musicians playing Turkish music. We went to a local family beach area and had fresh fish for lunch right on the water. This gave us a glimpse of the Black Sea. We got into a cab and headed back to the hotel. Luckily we got in the cab just before rain started, and it stopped right before we arrived.</p>

  <div class="journalCaption">David and our tour guide, Inci, having Turkish tea on the ferry.</div>

<p>We gathered up our things and headed to the ship. The ship is quite nice. Similar to last year's, although there's one less cabin deck and less open deck space. They had champagne and mimosas waiting for us when we arrived. All in all, we relaxed and watched the departure from port.</p>

&quot;Istanbul to Athens: Day at Sea&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/turkey/istanbul-athens-day-sea&quot;;&quot;<p>I won't spend too much time talking about the day at sea as all we did was lay in the sun and read. The sea was fantastically calm. Half of the time I didn't even know we were moving.</p>

</div>
<p>We did meet someone on the ship - That night we were enjoying the bough of the ship as we sailed into the night and a blond woman carrying a book, a glass of wine, and a cigarette came out to where we were and we got to talking. Her name is Pam and she's here with a large group, many of whom are anesthesiologists. Later in the trip, Pam became an invaluable source of gossip and amusement about a leathery, blond woman who was at least 50% silicone that walked around in a yellow thong bikini. We all had different names for her - Pam called her "Barbie," others on the ship called her "Miss Las Vegas" and David and I simply called her "Boobs." I wish I had a good picture of her, but I could never work up the guts. She and her husband were often in the gym.</p>&quot;;&quot;962946000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Kusadasi&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/turkey/kusadasi&quot;;&quot;<p>
         This stop is merely an excuse to see 
         <a href="http://www.the-eye.com/ephesus.htm" target="info">Ephesus</a>
         . We met Inci and got in a car to drive a half hour out of town. Our first stop was the house of Mary the Virgin Mother. It was found from a dying nun in another country that was having visions of talking to Mary. Eventually, someone started taking notes, and later a group of scientists set out to disprove the notes and discovered a monastery with a house that described the nun's description of Mary's house. The house was very small and simple and there was something calm and sacred about the house and the whole area (a monastery was nearby).

  <div class="journalCaption">The ruins of Ephesus.</div>
</div>
<p>After that we headed off to the ruins of Ephesus. I imagine we spent about two and a half hours going through the ruins. Inci was once again full of information. She apparently used to work at the ruins and so took us through some back areas - showing us places that most tourists were not getting to - and explaining how it all fit together. The ruins were far more extensive than Pompeii. The main centerpiece was the library, since the facade of this two-story building remained almost entirely intact. Perhaps the other reason I enjoyed it much more than Pompeii was that we took a tour guide and so got a better layout of the city and how it all fit together. She also showed us the first recorded advertisement, which was an engraving in the main walkway that gave directions to the brothel.</p>

  <div class="journalCaption">The theater at Ephesus. It is still used for rock/music concerts.</div>
</div>
<p>Next we went to the Basilica of St. John the Baptist. It was mainly in ruins, but she walked us through the layout and how it must have been built. And then the grounds keeper offered to show us his garden of fruits, flowers and vegetables, since they apparently knew each other. In general, the fresh produce in Turkey has been about the best quality I have ever seen.</p>
<p><b>Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</b>
         : This was our first stop that contained one of the former ancient wonders of the ancient world - 
         <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/artemis.html" target="info">The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus</a>

<p>We went back to Kusadasi after that and did some shopping. I slept most of the way back. That Inci is a taskmaster - and I had not yet had that first sleep that signals that jet lag is over.</p>
<p>That evening before dinner we spent some time in the lounge talking to Jim, a gentleman who is here with his traveling companion, Bob. And that night after dinner we had the sleep that we'd been waiting for.</p>&quot;;&quot;962946000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Rhodes&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/greece/rhodes&quot;;&quot;<p>Today we were at port in Rhodes before we awakened. We had break fast and headed into the city. Rhodes has the reputation of being the Florida of Europe. I think it's specifically the South Beach with a medieval section.</p>

<p>We set off to walk into town and a woman that we met on the ship stopped us and asked if we wouldn't mind if she walked with us. She's 82 and was ditched by her daughter. What can you say? So she walked in with us but we wore her out in a half hour.</p>

<p>The old City is a medieval town with areas where merchants have setup storefront tourist shops. We walked into the palace, which was restored for Mussolini, but l don't think he ever got a chance to use it. The Italians did a great job on the restoration. Pretty much every room had a fantastic mosaic that had been taken from another location. The Italians are big on recycling, as Benji would say.</p>
<p>We also went to a synagogue and Jewish museum. The Jewish population was quite strong is Rhodes before the Holocaust. And the only ones allowed in the old city used to be Turks and Jews.</p>
<p>Eventually we had to do lunch, and we found a small hole in the wall that was basically just someone's garden. They make only a few dishes a day, and so we had a little of everything. Real Greek Salad tastes much better than the American version. And the garden was lovely. We ate under lime trees.</p>
<p>Since we did not have the task master tour guide, Inci, we went back to the ship for a nap. After getting back to the city, David bought another rug at a place we had passed earlier. I just found out that David only brought one pair of shorts. What was he thinking? The other homosexuals came into the shop when David was bargaining and said hello. They may join us in Bodrum. We took a trip up to the old Clock Bell tower where there was a fantastic view of the city. There was a similar tower in Rab, Croatia with narrow, rickety steps. You just have to take a deep breath and assume that if the structure has survived this long, it will last another fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>For dinner we went to fish restaurant that was recommended by the guy that sold us the rug. Very good food. The walk through the noncommercial area at night was wonderful. With the quiet and the lamps along the narrow cobblestone streets, you really did feel transported to another time.</p>

&quot;Bodrum (formerly Halicarnassus)&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/turkey/bodrum-formerly-halicarnassus&quot;;&quot;<p>Yesterday was our last day in Turkey, and so our last day with Inci. We were joined by a Jim - the southern gentleman we met on the ship. Our first trek was through the Bodrum Castle, which, like many structures around here, started in the ancient world and then changed throughout the ages. They had some particularly interesting exhibits of underwater excavations. And the views throughout the castle were great.</p>

<p>After that we did a bit of shopping for knick-knacks and then rented a boat. He took us around to a few bays and then to a special spot called, "The Aquarium." It's supposedly called that because the water is so still and clear. I took a swim in the Aegean and then we went back to the docks.</p>
<p>We said our goodbyes to Inci and went back to the ship for a couple of very strong pina coladas. For dinner, we ate with Jim and Bob and two Brits, Brian and Neil. It was a very enjoyable dinner and we agreed to do the same the next night. We also had the first bits of rocky water, although it was not as bad as we had last year.</p>&quot;;&quot;962946000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Santorini&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/greece/santorini&quot;;&quot;<p>It took David and me a while to get into the rhythm of the day. He was a little spacey and draggy and I was crabby and snappy. Mainly because I had to go to an Internet cafe to handle a call from work. After that we rented a car and drove around the island. There were fantastic views all around, but I was not seeing what was so wonderful about the island until we got to the very north end to a town called Eio. This town is mainly at the top of a cliff, with the houses and Villas along the top and working their way halfway down the side. When you see cigarette ads for people dressed in white linen on a white patio over looking the water, this is the place. We took a long walk down to a thin rocky beach and had an iced coffee with baklava. Iced coffees in the Mediterranean are much creamier and dessert-like than in the U.S.</p>

<p>David talked me into hiring a donkey to take us back up the steps. There were a couple of other Americans that did it with us. The owner comes up behind and smacks the last donkey in the rear, so they all go somewhat quickly.</p>

<p>Dinner that evening was a BBQ on the pool deck. Our table Consisted of David and I, the two Brits - Brian and Neil, Jim - the Southern gentleman, and his traveling companion, Bob. We had a wonderful dinner, both in food and in company, looking up to the town of Thira atop the cliff beside us. Jim and Bob eventually went to bed, but the remaining four of us waited until the ship sailed away to see the lights of the villages dotting the top of the island.</p>&quot;;&quot;962946000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Mykonos&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/greece/mykonos&quot;;&quot;<p>The last day of the cruise. Getting the bill in the room is a real slap in the face. Although David and l have both said that we're ready to return, it still has been so wonderful that we don't want it to end.</p>

<p>So, at dinner we decided to rent or car and head to the naughty, clothing optional, somewhat gay, "Super Paradise" beach. Jim decided hot to go as he has seen plenty of beaches. The location was rather nice and had lots of beach chairs and wooden umbrellas to rent. It was somewhat empty when we got there, but was plenty full by the time we left. It was very mixed and very clothing optional. Fire Island had prepared me well. After a couple of hours at the beach, we went into town for a traditional Greek lunch, and then walked around town. Neil, who had been there 10 years ago, said that it was very run down compared to what it used to be. I have to admit that I was not impressed and after a while everyone was anxious to get back to the ship.</p>
<p>We rested. We showered. We felt better about life.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone was at the 7:15 debriefing so that they would know how to get off the ship. The captain gave a long speech about the whole trip. The brits taught us a new phrase - they said the captain is a bit of a "Jack the Lad" - meaning that he's a rambunctious boy at heart.</p>
<p>Dinner was once again very pleasant with Jim, Earl Bobby of Memphis (as we were now calling him), Neal, Brian, David and me. After dinner, David and I got to packing.</p>&quot;;&quot;962946000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;First Day in Athens&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/greece/first-day-athens&quot;;&quot;<p>Athens is hot. So very hot. Our hotel is a bit of a fleabag. Actually, it's a flea sauna. We're supposed to be here for two nights.</p>

<p>We figured, "At nine in the morning. How hot could it be?" and went to the Acropolis. It was very hot. We asked around for a guide at the entrance, but luckily there wasn't one. A tour guide would have been added torture.  The Acropolis was grand; we took some pictures, and got the hell out.</p>

<p>Next we walked to the National Museum, which had some very good examples of sculpture and statue. Lunch was much needed, as I was fading pretty hard in the museum, despite a little water break in the cafeteria. We made a stop at an Internet cafe and then headed back to the hotel room.</p>

<p>David announced at the hotel that the heat was too much. We called British Air about going to London early and they said we had a ninety nine percent chance of making the next flight. Well, she was ninety nine percent wrong. We waited on standby for about three and a half hours. The Athens airport is a pit. We went back to the hotel with our tails between our legs and checked back in. For dinner, we went to the Plaka, which is the tourist section with restaurants and shops, and had a great dinner at a place called Diogenes (named after the philosopher). Once again, the heat was getting to David since we were sitting outside along a park. So we went back to the hotel.</p>

&quot;Last Day in Athens&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/greece/last-day-athens&quot;;&quot;<p>We left the air conditioner running on high all night and my sheets were wet with sweat when we woke up. The first thing I did was go to get a bottle of water out of the mini-bar, but it was empty. We are changing hotels. Other people on the boat had mentioned the Sheraton, so it was off to the Sheraton we went.</p>
<p>The Sheraton was much more luxurious and most importantly - WELL AIR-CONDITIONED! The other big plus about the hotel was that there were other people from the ship staying there. In particular, Pam's group was there and we often ran into them in the lobby. David and I agreed that we want Pam's travel agent from now on.</p>
<p>
         We took a trip to the 
         <a href="http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21101a/e211aa03.html" target="info">Ancient Agora</a>
         . This was much more bearable since there were trees and therefore, shade. Actually, the Temple of Hephaistos, while not as large as the Parthenon, was in much better shape. Frankly, we were getting a little "over-ruined" and although it was interesting we weren't spending as much time on this as would if it were at the beginning of the trip.
      </p>
<p>We went back to the hotel, ran into some people from the ship, and they recommended an air-conditioned restuarant. When we got there, we ran into Pam's group, so clearly, this was the place to eat. The food was good and a crash was imminent. We went back to the hotel for reading and napping. I took a little stroll around the town before dinner for some pictures and ran into a bead stores, where I picked up some "Turkish Eyes."</p>
<p>For dinner, we asked the hotel for a a simple, nearby recommendation and they sent us to a true Greek diner. The waitstaff looked to be in their seventies and very pleasant - the atmosphere looked to be from the 1950's - and the food was good.</p>
<p>The rest of the trip was uneventful. We were ready to be home. We were on the flight the next morning and spent the whole day in the air.</p>

&quot;Saturday: Arrival in Nice&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/saturday-arrival-nice&quot;;&quot;<p>I can't say that we had the best flight to Nice. We couldn't get seats together on the flight 
out, but a woman was kind enough to switch with us. We didn't sleep much at all on the 
flight over, so by the time we got to Heathrow, we were pretty tired. And then our flight 
kept getting delayed, we got stuck on the runway, and we sat next to this crazy woman 
that kept shifting every five seconds and was crying (literally) about not being able to sit 
at the window. Anyway, we got to Nice and had a pleasant taxi ride to the hotel. The 
taxis in France are luxurious compared with what we are used to in New York. Pretty 
much as soon as we got settled in the hotel, we took a nap. We woke up around 7pm and 
went for a walk in the old part of Nice (Le Vieux Nice). Finding a restaurant was not 
hard, but finding a restaurant that was not just a pizzeria where we could get served 
relatively quickly turned out to be rather daunting. We ended up ordering pizzas at a 
more formal-looking restaurant and they just got their pizzas from the place next door. I 
guess you could say that we benefited from the service of the friendly waiter and the 
fruity aperitif. After that we went to the ice cream shops to end all ice cream shops. They 
had at least 50 flavors, each one had a little sample atop the mound - for instance, banana 
had a slice of banana on top of the ice cream so you could tell what it was, amaretto had 
an amaretto cookie, etc. They even had savory flavors such as thyme and rosemary. After 
ice cream, we went back to the hotel and I completely zonked out.</p>

&quot;Sunday: 2nd Day in Nice - Nonstop Israelis&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/sunday-2nd-day-nice-nonstop-israelis&quot;;&quot;<p>I barely remember waking up enough to join David for breakfast. I went back to the hotel 
room, took a little post-breakfast nap, a long bath, and then decided to greet the day. I 
took a walk through Old Nice again, going a little closer to the coast. I ended up at 
Promenade des Anglais and walked through the open market. They had fruit stands, 
flower strands, marzipan fruit stands, and spice stands with every spice you could 
imagine. David called me on my cell phone and said that he had time to do lunch. We 
met in the area of the open market for an uneventful but delicious lunch.</p>

<p>After lunch I decided to go to the Musée Chagall. I left the hotel and in one block 
realized I was lost. I took a new direction and discovered in two blocks, I was still lost. I 
eventually did get there, but I took many wrong turns and probably spent twice as much 
time walking as was necessary. The visit was well worth it. This particular museum was 
dedicated to images of the Old Testament. I always thought Chagall's work was 
interesting, but seeing his work together, especially the 17 images of the Biblical 
Message, made me a convert. After the museum visit, I knew the direction that the hotel 
was in, so I decided to be lost for a while. I wandered around a wealthy section of town 
looking at houses before heading back to the hotel.</p>
<p>David finished his conference duties about the same time I got back. His presentation 
went well. We decided to take a walk up to the town park, which is high on a bluff. There 
are some ruins and a large, planned waterfall that can be seen from pretty much any point 
in the city. On the way up, we ran into an Israeli colleague of David's. The park also has 
two cemeteries: one of which is a Jewish cemetery. Both cemeteries were closed, but we 
peeked in and were very impressed with what we saw.</p>

<p>After the park excursion, we met two other Israelis, Benny and Chanah, for dinner. We

&quot;Monday: St. Paul de Vence&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/monday-st-paul-de-vence&quot;;&quot;<p>I used to think that Santorini was the ideal honeymoon location: I'm now convinced that 
the ideal spot is St. Paul de Vence. It's a small walled city that is inland from the rest of 
the Cote D'Azur coastal resorts, high on a hill. The streets are winding and confusing, but 
the only thing to do is wander around and look at shops. It was primarily art galleries, but 
we also found some cloth shops, candy shops, spice shops, and a fantastic shop that had 
all sorts of homemade liqueurs. We sampled and bought fig, blueberry, and red peach 
liqueurs.</p>

like a 1960's suburban synagogue, and walked back to St. Paul de Vence for lunch. We 
did a little more touring of the town, including a stop for crepes, and then headed back to

<p>For dinner, we went to L'Auberge de Acropolis, which is a very local restaurant off the 
beaten path. No one in the restaurant spoke anything but French. The owner was very 
frustrated that he could not communicate with us, as he was extremely sociable with 
everyone else. We had a very good food translation section in one of our guidebooks, so 
we knew more or less what we were ordering. There was a man eating alone next to us 
that also only spoke French, trying to make pleasant conversation. We told him we were 
from New York City. At one point it sounding like he said "Boosh" (as in G. W.) and 
made hand signals that led us to believe that he was offering condolences for the World 
Trade Center attack. He gave as some of his grappas, an extremely potent grape liqueur, 
and we toasted his hospitality, using most of David's twelve words of French vocabulary. 
The owner's lovable german shepherd sat in the corner and came over once for some 
affection.  Or was it to lick the food off my hand?</p>&quot;;&quot;1014962400&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Tuesday: Aix en Provence&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/tuesday-aix-en-provence&quot;;&quot;<p>We got a relatively early start this morning. David was anxious to get out of the "Miami 
Beach" atmosphere of Nice and on to the provincial setting of Provence. We picked up a 
rented car and with David as the navigator and myself as the driver, we went to Aix-en-
Provence. I think it took us around two hours. After we checked into the hotel, we went 
for a brief walking tour. Almost every town in Provence has an office of tourism with 
maps of the town, things to do, etc. After getting a lot of maps and a pass to all of the 
museums, went for a walk around the town. Aix has a beautiful old city, so we wandered 
the medieval streets and went into a few small museums. It is also known as the city of a 
thousand fountains. We turned out to be rather tired, so after some touring, we went back 
to the hotel room and took a nap. For dinner, we ate outside in a public square. A lot of 
the cafes and restaurants are only big enough for the kitchen and the staff and the seating 
is outside.</p>

&quot;Wednesday: Avignon and Surroundings&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/wednesday-avignon-and-surroundings&quot;;&quot;<p>This was the first day that I woke up feeling like a normal person. We drove to Avignon, 
which is a walled city that was once the home of the French popes-back in the 1300's 
and 1400's. We had breakfast and then took a two-hour tour of the Palais des Papes. 
Afterwards, we walked around the city, tried to go to a museum, but we hit the lunch 
hour and everything started closing. We went to a pastry shop for a goat cheese and 
spinach pastry and a smoked duck sandwich. Fantastic.</p>

<p>We drove up a bit along the Rhone River to Chateauneuf du Pape, which is famous for its 
wines (this is silly because the whole area is famous for its wines). We went into a "cave" 
(which is a wine tasting cellar) and bought some wine. We traveled on to Orange, but by 
then it was pouring down rain. We stopped for some coffee and a crepe and re-planned 
the rest of the day.</p>
<p>We decided to hit the open road and travel through Provence. After several wrong turns, 
we saw some spectacular little towns - we drove over cobblestone bridges that took us 
over moats into walled villages. The views were fantastic, and I'm afraid the pictures just 
don't do the area justice. I used to think that Santorini was the ideal honeymoon location: 
I'm now convinced that the ideal is a small town in Provence. Two of the highlights are 
St. Didier and Bonnieux, but there were several hotel/restaurants that were near small 
towns but self-contained retreats. Somewhere along this road we made an important 
turning point in our vacation: we stopped trying to pronounce the town names correctly 
and started pronouncing them phonetically.</p>

<p>Next we stopped into a little tourist trap that I fell in love with. It's an area where water 
comes out of the bottom of a cliff, and no one knows where the source of the water is. It's 
called Font de Vaucluse ("The Source") and there are nonstop consumer stands as you 
walk along the river up to the source. However, there was a little medieval town along the 
river with restaurants pretty much right on top of the water. It was a 10 on the quaint 
scale.</p>

<p>We drove some more and ended up in Pertuis for dinner. It was not a big town, but had a 
very nice Moroccan restaurant. After dinner, we drove back to the hotel and crashed.</p>&quot;;&quot;1014962400&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Thursday: Chateaus of Provence&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/thursday-chateaus-provence&quot;;&quot;<p>Today we started by driving out to hit some of the chateaux (castles) of the area. We went 
to Chateau Barben, which is right next to the local zoo. The grounds were fantastic, but 
the only way to see it was to go with the tour, which we had just missed. We decided to 
come back.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Le Beaux, which is another walled village, high on a mountaintop. The 
views were stunning, but by this time, we were actually starting to get picky about our 
mega-quaint, medieval, walled villages. We did a bit of touring, had a magnificent lunch, 
and took the slow road back to Chateau Barben. We got the tour of the Chateau, which 
has, of course, spectacular views. Many of the rooms were very well stocked with period 
furniture. One of the highlights was a room that was wallpapered with leather. The 
leather had designs imprinted upon it and was original to the Chateau.</p>

<p>We returned to Aix and did a little shopping. I found a kitchen supply store and went a 
little nuts.</p>
<p>For dinner that evening, we had one of the best meals I've had in my life. I started with a 
cream of leak soup that had tomatoes and sausage in it. My main course was a steak 
stuffed with foie gras, served with green onions wrapped in bacon. And dessert was 
unbelievable: it was four small desserts based on a chestnut theme. There was chestnut 
mousse, chestnut créme brulee, some sort of chestnut pudding in a shot glass with 
whipped cream, and chestnut ice cream. I can't remember what David had other than the 
foie gras for an appetizer. After his first bite, he said, "I am ordering foie gras at every 
meal from now on."</p>&quot;;&quot;1014962400&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Friday: Cavaillon, Carpentras, and Gordes&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/friday-cavaillon-carpentras-and-gordes&quot;;&quot;<p>Today, there was more touring of Provence. We started off going to Cavaillon to see a 
cathedral and a synagogue. The cathedral and cloister were beautiful and the synagogue 
was a highlight. When we arrived, the museum attendant said that in order to see the 
synagogue (which is one average sized room), we had to get the tour. However, she 
spoke only French. David said to her in French (in a friendly and joking manner), 
"You're in a synagogue, we should be able to speak Hebrew." She replied with, "You're 
in France, you should be able to speak French." Anyway, she gave us a 40-minute tour of 
the synagogue to us and one other woman that was occasionally able to translate. 
However, David's French turned out to be eerily good, and he was able to communicate 
excellently. In fact, he translated some of the Hebrew in the synagogue for them. She 
gave us much more than a tour of the synagogue - she went into great detail about the 
lives and the history of the Jews throughout all of Provence.</p>

<p>Next was Carpentras, which is known for an excellent Friday market. The whole town is 
transformed into a giant open market with meats, cheeses, produce, clothes, honey, 
lavender, etc. We caught the very end of the market and had lunch. I found an excellent 
patisserie that had canelles, which I've heard of, but have never tried. We bought some 
things to take with us for later in the afternoon as well as some gifts. There was a 
beautiful cathedral that we visited before heading on.</p>
<p>Next was Gordes, which is another ueber-quaint, medieval, walled city high on a hill. 
They specialize in mortarless fences and houses, but we didn't go for the real tour. We 
walked around, had our pastries (a real macaroon, a real florentin, and a real canelé), had 
some coffee, and then headed back to Aix.</p>

<p>On the way back to Aix we made a brief stop in Lacoste to visit the Marquis de Sade's 
chateau. It was heavily ruined, but we got a cheap thrill out of being able to say, "We 
visited the Marquis de Sade's chateau."</p>

<p>For dinner, we went to a restaurant that is featured in one of Peter Mayles' books about 
Provence. It was very homey, rustic-very provincial. David had better luck ordering, his 
meal was heart-stoppingly good, while mine was only wonderful. We stumbled back to 
the hotel room drunk-well, not exactly stumbled, but we were giggly and silly. It was 
our last night in Aix.</p>&quot;;&quot;1014962400&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Saturday: St. Maximin and Return to Nice&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/saturday-st-maximin-and-return-nice&quot;;&quot;<p>We had a few outstanding items left in Aix. We had some museums to see still, and I 
wanted to get my hair cut in France. Since I had asked someone at work to write out 
directions to a hair stylist in French, I knew they would be disappointed if I didn't come 
back with a kooky French hairdo. We first went to Atelier Cezanne, which was the 
artist's painting studio. We visited the Museum Tapisserrie (Tapestry Museum). And 
then I went to get my hair cut. I was very nervous, but it ended up being no big deal. 
They gave me some magazines and I pointed to a haircut and said, "Like this." It ended 
up being a very good haircut. I told the stylist (we communicated in broken English) that 
I would have to return to Aix in six weeks for my next haircut. I don't think he got it.</p>

<p>So then we hit side roads to go back to Nice. We had most of the day ahead of us, so we 
were still in tour mode. We stopped at a village that was on the way that ended up being a 
highlight of the trip. The Basilica of St. Maximin turns out to be the traditional burial 
place of Mary Magdalene. The chapel alone was magnificent - it was very well preserved 
during the French Revolution because Napoleon's younger brother used it as a storage 
depot and had the Marseillaise continuously played on the organ. However, the macabre 
highlight was the crypt where St. Maximin, St. Innocent, and Mary Magdalene were all 
buried. Mary Magdalene's crypt had a gold bust reliquary with the facemask gone, 
showing the skull of her remains. I really wanted to take a picture, but it seemed 
disrespectful.</p>

<p>Eventually, we ran out of quaint villages and hit the main highway back to Nice. We 
stayed at a different hotel room that was a little nicer. Our last meal in France was very 
good, but nothing too different than what we had been having.</p>&quot;;&quot;1014962400&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Travel to the South of France&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/provence/travel-south-france&quot;;&quot;We went to the South of France expecting cold and dour people and sunny weather. We got just the opposite. Nice was once part of Italy, and we began speculating that when the Italians handed Nice back to France they said, "We'll give you Nice back, but you have to be friendly to the tourists and serve lots of pizza." However, the same was true for all of Provence-the people could not have been friendlier. I guess my only exposure to French culture so far has been the Parisians where the rule is to be snooty to the tourists.The weather was...not as bad as it could have been. There was only one day that was continually rainy. Most days were nice in the mornings with a little drizzle in the afternoon. We were there in April, so what can you expect?

&quot;The Trip to the Czech Republic&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/prague/trip-czech-republic&quot;;&quot;<p>Our first day in Prague was really two. We left the house a little late, and than found out that we were dealing with rain, holiday weekend, and Friday afternoon traffic. We got to the airport as they were boarding the flight - in fact, it was mostly full when we got there. So we got two middle seats. For an over night flight. Yay. However, the flight to Zurich went relatively quickly. we had a five hour layover in Zurich, and we saw something about day rooms. So we decided to check them out. They were very white, sterile rooms with a communal toilet and Shower down the hall. We were so dead tired, we decided to rent one. And it turns out they made quite a difference. Waking up was sheer torture, but once I was up, I felt distinctly better. Also, the shower felt fantastic.</p>
<p>The Swiss Air flight was a wonderful welcome to Europe. They served a fantastic smoked ham and herb cheese sandwich followed by Swiss chocolates. I looked at David and commented on the food in Europe. He said, "Low fat. What's that?"</p>

The driver reminded me of Kornblum from "Kavalier &amp; Clay." the hotel was nice and didn't have one of those funny "shelf" toilets that I see in Eastern Europe.

<p>I have to admit, the first day in Prague was a bit of a blur. We were operating on only a few hours of sleep. The subway took us near the Old Town, and we started walking. There was no great destination in mind. We came across Tulla and her Finnish associates. Tulla was looking vivacious. But her colleagues didn't recognize that we existed. I had a list of cafes in Prague, and so we headed to one on the list. It was a beautiful art deco building. We sat outside, listening to their musicians and had an iced cappucino - which had no ice, but a lot of cream, and some sort of syrup or liquor. We headed over to the old Town Square, checked out the churches and architecture, and waited for the Astrological Clock to chime. As I had read about the various machinations that the clock goes through, it seemed sort of fun or cute, but when I saw it happening, I realized it was quite haunting. The second I saw the apostles start to parade past the open windows, I felt like a kid.</p>

<p>We walked across the Charles Bridge. I will have to do that again, because the sun was in our eyes and I was quite tired. We found a restaurant that was popular with the locals in the Little Quarter. My meal was big, but David's was enormous. We both had beer. After a heavy meal, beer, and jet lag, we stumbled out of the restaurant drunk and found a cab. We later realized that the cab driver recognized drunk tourists and significantly over charged us.</p>

The town is an old mining town, which used to act as the mint for the Czech Republic. The town ranks high on the "quant scale"; but unfortunately, our tour guide was not so great. At our first stop, a beautiful church, she simply read from the english text that they give all tourists. She also added extra prepositions to the text and occassionally asked for help with words like "apron". Worse yet, we found out that the tour would not be stopping at the ossuary. So instead of going back to Prague with the tour, we went to the ossuary on our own. It was a beautiful day and the walk was only a few kilometers.</p>

<p>The ossuary was small, but quite amazing. the pictures do it some justice, but it's better to see it in person. Oddly enough, it did not seem morose. And only macabre from a distance. Up close, it was amazing beautiful. The chandelier has at least one of every bone in the human body.</p>

<p>After the ossuary, we walked a little further to the train Station.</p>
<p>We almost didn't realize that we had to transfer trains, but everything worked out well. We went back to the hotel - I relaxed and David went to the meeting for a bit.</p>
<p>For the evening's entertainment, David and guest were invited on a river boat with dinner and music. Granted, it was a bunch of doctors, but it turned out to be a lovely evening. The boat took us from one side of Prague to the other, with two stops in a lock. Looking at Prague at night was magical. There have been many times on the trip so far that I have thought, "So this is what they mean by Bohemia." I've been searching for words to describe it. It's more than just an epicurean lifestyle. That word always mates me think of France, where they take epicurianism very seriously. The Czech enjoyment of the pleasures in life is somehow devoid of hedonism. It's youthful without being immature. And it's entirely unselfconscious. More than Paris, this is a city I can imagine myself staying in - writing in journals, attending concerts, sitting by the banks of the river naively enjoying life.</p>

&quot;Food Hangover&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/prague/food-hangover&quot;;&quot;<p>I'm having a hard time this morning, because I'm having a bit of a food hangover. We went out with friends of David to a place that turned out to be a tourist trap. It's called "U Kalicha" and is based on a popular Czech novel, "The Good Soldier." It was a stereo typical Eastern European event, complete with an accordion player and a tuba player. As soon as they sat us down, they looked at us and said, "Beer?" We said yes and they brought us each the biggest mug of beer I have ever seen. It had to have been at least a liter. Then, while we were looking over the menus, they came around with Slivovitz and asked it we wanted shots. My stomach lining begged for mercy. I was afraid that dinner was going to be over the top, but it was typical Czech food. We had an appetizer with a lot of pork and cheese, and all the men ordered roast goose and the one female ordered a salad. I think with the combination of food and beer, I have a bit of a food hangover this morning.</p>
<p>So now, let's backtrack to earlier in the day. David made an appearance at the conference after breakfast, while I wrote and read. We headed off to Prague castle first. I got the bright idea of walking through the gardens to enter, which entailed a very hearty trek up the side of a hill. There were may school groups waiting outside the castle. One of the groups was a group of about 20 preteen girls. One of them said hello to us quite loudly. David said hello back. Then all 20 of them said hello to us in unison. The first girl, the ring leader, asked us where we were from. We said "New York" and all 20 girls started screaming with excitement. We figured that they must be from some small German town and were practicing their English.</p>

<p>So back to the castle. The highlight of the castle is the cathedral. It's enormous and beautiful. I think the only church that I've seen that's more impressive is St. Peter's in Rome - and no one will ever top that one. It is also interesting to note that there were some relatively recent pieces of art as part of the cathedral. Especially beautiful was an art nouveau stained glass window. I always tend to think that its a shame that they can't build modern buildings to be as majestic as they used to be, but this cathedral helped show that something doesn't have to be old to be beautiful.</p>

<p>Next we went on to a palace. There were many great halls and a room where two discs were pushed out of a window - setting off the Thirty Years War. The palace had a few large entrances especially designed for people riding in on horseback.</p>

</div>
<p>Next, we ventured on to a small street where Kafka lived for a short while with his sister. The houses were all painted in pastels. It looked too quaint and cheerful for Kafka's residence.</p>
<p>We left the castle and ventured across the river into the Jewish Quarter. We saw the Old-New Synagogue, which is really centuries old and is where the Golum is supposedly still resting. Right around the corner is the Jewish Cemetery. l was quite moved when we got to Rabbi Leow's grave - the rabbi that created the Golum. I've been thinking a lot about Kavalier &amp; Clay.</p>

</div>
<p>After the Jewish Quarter, we went in search of an English bookstore. I bought David "I Served the King of England" and we had a coffee. The bookstore and cafe felt very communist era. I imagine that life must have been very quiet for the average person back then - and extremely boring. As it stands now, capitalism has not taken too strong of a foothold here. There are people selling shot glasses and T-shirts with images of Prague, but there's surprisingly little advertising. There is a calm silence that has remained.</p>
<p>After the bookstore, we went back to the hotel for a nap and then on to the dinner that I've already told you about.</p>&quot;;&quot;1051765200&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;On My Own in Prague&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/prague/my-own-prague&quot;;&quot;<p>David was at conferences most of today, so I did some exploring on my own. I started off near the Prague Castle to check out some of the "Little Quarter". My first attempt at reading the map resulted in a wrong turn. Once I re adjusted, I was fine for the rest of my excursion.</p>
<p>My first stop was at Wallenstein Palace. It is essentially a senate house with large public gardens. It was full of statues, frescoes, and had a little area that housed some owls. There was also this very large, bizarre wall called "The Grotesguery" that's made to look like limestone stallactites. It did look like that, but I couldn't figure out what the points was.</p>

<p>After the palace gardens, I wandered around the neighborhood and ended up by the Church of St. Nicholas. Once again, I was not prepared for how majestic the churches would be in Prague. The picture here does not do it justice. I should have taken more pictures, but I always feel tacky taking pictures of a church. Well, I feel tacky taking pictures all the time. So in this picture, compare the size of the people to the size of the church. Along the altars are giant white marble statues of saints and patrons of the church.</p>

<p>I came back down to the river and walked along Kampa Park which is a park along the river. It's not known for anything in particular except that it's relaxing and pleasant and off the tourist path somewhat. I sat on a bench and enjoyed looking at the locals enjoy a tranquility in life that you just don't see in the U.S.</p>
<p>I went back to the Old Town via the Charles Bridge. I took a picture of people rubbing a stature for good luck. The statue has two brass reliefs: one of a man and his dog and one of a saint leaping off a bridge. People had started touching the falling saint for good luck and at some point, I assume after the lines for touching the saint got to be too much, people decided that touching the dog was good luck too. So now both the saint and the dog are shiny from everyone touching them.</p>

<p>On the way back to the hotel, I stopped by the river, made a wish, and threw a coin into the river. I'll let you know if it comes true.</p>
<p>For dinner that night, David and I went to a small restuarant behind a convent. It was partially outside and the night was perfect for semi-outside dining. I have to admit that the heavy eastern european food was starting to get to me at this point. We stumbled back to the subway after dinner, going through side streets and trying to walk off the heavy food. We saw nuns in the convent fixing up their rooms. We listened to the sounds of classical music in people's apartments.</p>&quot;;&quot;1051765200&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Sad to Return&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/prague/sad-return&quot;;&quot;<p>So we got to the hotel and packed. Nothing too eventful. The flight home was a little trying. The flight to Zurich was in front of two blabber mouths that couldn't talk below a shout. And American Airlines didn't have us sitting together on the way home. We were persistent in our complaining and eventually got two seats together. The flight felt very long on the way home.</p>
<p>It turns out that I brought a friend home from Prague in my stomach. I couldn't go to work the next day - it felt like I swallowed glass. But after a day of rest, I was ready to go back to work. Well, as ready as I was going to get.</p>
<p>I left a lot of things yet to do in Prague. I found an antique map shop for David that he didn't have time to visit, so there's something calling David there, too. I will never pass up a trip to Prague.</p>&quot;;&quot;1051765200&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Long Weekend in Prague&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/prague/long-weekend-prague&quot;;&quot;<p>When I was at marchFIRST, David asked if I would join him on a trip to Prague. I said yes at the time, but then a major project at work was scheduled to go live near the time of our trip, so I backed out. Then marchFIRST went bankrupt. I vowed never to pass up a vacation for work again. Well, Century 21 scheduled a project to go live within a month of my trip, and I said "screw it, I'm going!"</p>&quot;;&quot;1051765200&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Tuscany&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/tuscany/tuscany&quot;;&quot;When people talk about travel, Italy comes up a lot. I always mention Rome which still stands out in my mind as a place I could see myself happily trapped in. A standard response I get is "Have you been to Florence? You haven't seen nothing yet."

David and I were trying to plan our big trip for that year. We looked at several options but either the timing didn't work out, or the flights getting there and back were too difficult, or the whole thing would have been too expensive. Then, all of a sudden, we over looked the obvious. Why don't we just go to Florence and spend a week driving around Tuscany? It was the perfect plan and ended up being one of the most perfect vacations I have ever been on.&quot;;&quot;1096606800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Torre di Bellosguardo&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/tuscany/torre-di-bellosguardo&quot;;&quot;<p>It turns out that getting in and out of Florence is not so easy. We decided to fly to Rome, take the train to Florence, and then take a cab to our hotel. So, yes, that meant that the first day of travel was kind of hellish. However, the hotel that greeted us at our arrival was WELL worth it! I think it was more than just the jet-lag - our hotel (the Torre di Bellosguardo) felt like a dream. And I don't mean to say that it was idyllic (although it was), it was like a dream when you're in a big house with hallways and stairwells going all different places. When the porter took us to our room, I got lost. I couldn't find any other hotel rooms! Our room was off of an old banquet hall and there didn't seem to be any other guest rooms off of it. (I did some exploring later in the week and we did find a few more rooms.)</p>

<p>And that takes us to our room. It was magnificent. It's the only hotel room that I've ever missed when I left. Everything was antique - even the artwork on the walls was medieval. We had two windows. Out of one window was an unbelievable view of Florence. Out of the other window was a view of the gardens. We could only hear two sounds really: an occassional church bell from Florence and a braying donkey. The donkey lived on the property. We went looking for him one day, but we never spotted him.</p>

<p>One day we took some time to explore the gardens of the property. It took us a while. They grew all their own fruits and vegetables. There were plenty of birds flittering about. There was also a pool, but we were more interested in exploring than hanging out by a pool. Also, October weather was not so hot that we felt the need to cool off by the water.</p>

&quot;Florence&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/tuscany/florence&quot;;&quot;<p>David signed us up for two walking tours, which ended up being a very good idea. Our first day in Florence, we had a four hour walking tour that covered most of Florence, followed by lunch, and then a tour of Michaelangelo's David.</p>
<p>The walking tour gave us an excellent overview of Tuscany: who are the Medici's, what are these crests we keep seeing on buildings, etc. The tour guide had a seemingly limitless supply of stories about the city. I started becoming suspicious at all the commonly known phrases that seemed to originate from Florence. For instance, "saved by the bell" comes from the story of a woman that buried alive, but was able to ring a bell so that someone could hear her and dig up the grave. The phrase "I ate at a little hole in the wall" refers to the small doors next to the kitchen where wealthy families would hand out scraps to beggars. You get the idea. Regardless of their authenticity, all the stories were captivating.</p>

<p>We heard many stories of tempermental artists. Donatello was high on the list of divas. There was a story that he had made a statue and he was showing it to the patron on a rooftop. The patron made some criticisms of the statue and Donatello said, "You're right. It's junk." and shoved the stature off the rooftop and letting it shatter to a million pieces. My hero.</p>

<p>For the afternoon, we had two major events for which unfortunately, I cannot show any photographs: Michaelangelo's David and the Uffizi Gallery. Both were breathtaking. I have had experiences in the past in which I looked at a major piece of artwork and said "I don't get it." Not the case with Michaelangelo's David. Our guide also did a very good job explaining the context and what Michaelangelos was attempting to do with the sculpture. It really is one of those "run, don't walk" kind of things.</p>
<p>And the Uffizi had some amazing pieces of artwork: Several Botticelli's including "Birth of Venus", Michaelangelo's Pieta, and many others.</p>

&quot;San Gemignano&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/tuscany/san-gemignano&quot;;&quot;<p>After two days of touring Florence, we were ready to hit the road and see more of Tuscany. In general, I found the Tuscans drove quickly, but fairly. Of course, we wouldn't dare driving in the actual towns. Usually, the goal was to park just outside the medieval walls and walk in.</p>
<p>San Gemignano is built on a hill and looks like a small mideival Manhattan with towering spires. They had one main church with incredible murals, but one is not allowed to take photographs.</p>

<p>We walked around the tower. Even making Pisa the first stop of the day, there were plenty of tourists. I can only imagine what it would be like to hit Pisa later in the day. We were not prepared for how stunning the cathedral is. Apparently, Pisa was a center in the area for the moors, and it shows in the artwork. There is an odd mixture of Arabic geometric designs with Catholic iconography. It's especially noticeable in the baptistry. Here are a ton of photos of the cathedral.</p>

<p>There were two other villas in the area. One was definitely closed. The other was perhaps not as nice, but the woman let us in to wander around. There were a couple of dogs that followed us. I made the mistake of petting one, and he decided he didn't want me to go and clamped onto my wrist and wouldn't let go. After a couple of minutes of trying to coax him into letting go, I started to get a little nervous, and we shouted for the woman that let us in. He did loose interest and we were free to roam the grounds.</p>

&quot;Sienna&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/tuscany/sienna&quot;;&quot;<p>Although I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite city in Tuscany, a couple of people told me that they thought Sienna to be one of the most beautiful cities they've ever been to. It certainly ranks quite high. We set today to be almost exclusively dedicated to Sienna. There's a breathtaking cathedral, wonderul shops, local cuisine, and great history.</p>

<p>I know I said that the cathedral at Pisa was incredible. Well, the cathedral in Sienna was incredible, too. There's something about Sienna that feels "lived in". In some ways, you could see yourself living in Sienna i na way that you can't imagine yourself in other cities. And on the other hand, there are ways in which you realize that you could never belong to Sienna because it only belongs to its locals.</p>

<p>This was a good place for tourist tchotchkes. It was also a good place for local food. One of my favorite recipes is a Sienna Tart that I got from one of my first cookbooks. It's based on "panforte" from Sienna. We bought several to give to friends and eat for ourselves. For lunch we ate at a local place. I don't think I mentioned this before, Sienna is very hilly. We got quite a workout walking around this city. You can see how they've levelled the tables and chairs for the outdoor seating in this restaurant.</p>

We did a little sightseeing, had gelato at one of the world famous gelato places, and then went to our respective shopping excursions.</p>
<p>On our earlier visits, one of the churches, Snata Croce, was closed. We went back and it was open. There are several famous Florentines buried here.</p>

<p>Since being back, it's taken me weeks to get over a sadness that I can't start every day with a cappucino and a pastry, staring at rennaisance sculpture and architecture. There are many things here that aren't documented: the Italian Alps, the palace at Florence, the city hall at Sienna, the restuarants we went to, and countless of other details. Everyone deserves as much time in Tuscany as you can muster. Run, don't walk. This was a vacation I will not forget.</p>&quot;;&quot;1096606800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Israel&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/israel&quot;;&quot;In September of 2005, David and I had a rendezvous in Zurich and flew to Israel for a week. This was probably David's 8th trip there, but it was my first. What was I expecting? I don't really know. Pushy people on crowded streets, perhaps; hot, arid weather; and so many armed guards as to make one constantly nervous. Boy, was I wrong.

Yes, the security was heavy, but it was far more unintrusive than I was expecting. It was comforting more than alarming. I get he same sort of safe feeling in New York. The weather was surprisingly moderate. It was sunny and warm everyday and as long as I wore a hat and sunglasses outside, I was fine. And the people were not nearly as pushy as I thought. Well, I take that back. The merchants in Jerusalem were to a level of pushy that I had never seen before - but the average citizen merely maintained a reasonable level of frankness.

We had three nights in Tel Aviv (on the coast) and three nights in Jerusalem (in the desert). I had two days on my own in Tel Aviv. I arrived with almost no plans whatsoever. I only had two carry on bags and no coat when I left New York. The only thing that had prepared me for this trip was a dream that I had a couple of months ago about visiting Israel which ended up being oddly prophetic.&quot;;&quot;1125550800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Tel Aviv & Jaffa&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/tel-aviv-jaffa&quot;;&quot;<p>David and I met in Zurich and flew together to Tel Aviv. He had flown from Australia and I had flown from New York City. Needless to say, there was some jet lag - especially on David's part. The first few days, we were staying in Tel Aviv for a conference. When we got to the hotel, they didn't have a room for us, even though David was an invited guest speaker. The hotel across the street didn't have a room either. After about 2 hours of a cab ride and some mild shouting, we got a room at the Crown Plaza. It was significantly better than the hotel at the conference. We had heard from other people at the conference that the other hotel had air conditioning problems. Our hotel was like a refrigerator. So it turned out to be a blessing in disguise.</p>

  <div class="journalCaption">A view of the Tel Aviv beach from our hotel room.</div>
</div>
<p>Tel Aviv is a mostly modern city, so there isn't much to see in terms of tourist spots, other than museums and such. However, there's so much to see in the rest of Israel, that I took tours to other parts of the country while David was at the conference.</p>
<p>The one big exception is Jaffa, which is a small neighborhood at the southern end of Tel Aviv. It's filled with small art galleries and other shops. It's particularly beautiful at night. David got a recommendation to go to a restaurant owned by the Israeli version of Emeril LaGasse. The food was excellent. I'm still dreaming about my dessert which was chocolate-cardamom ice cream with a caramel sauce.</p>

&quot;Galilee&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/galilee&quot;;&quot;<p>On our first full day, I took a tour to the Sea of Galilee to see spots that are famous in the New Testament. Our tour guide was Solomon Golan and there were two other guests on the tour. Our first stop was to Nazareth, where we visited the Church of the Annunciation. This is the spot where the angel Gabriel told Mary what she was going to give birth to Jesus. Unfortunately, the original church that was built there is long gone. You learn quickly in Israel that almost everything was destroyed by either the Romans, the Syrians, the Turks, or the Crusaders. However, there were still some remnants of the old church left.</p>

<p>After we left the church, we went to a little shop where I had some Turkish coffee (yea, caffeine!) and some date juice (never had that before). Our guide, Solomon, stopped at a "tabboun" and got some fresh pita bread. The bread was about the size of a pizza and covered with olive oil and spices. Since it was fresh from the oven, we had to wait to let it cool down, which was fine because the traffic out of Nazareth was very slow. This was also my first realization that there are plenty of areas in Israel where Jews and Arabs live with little to no conflict. Nazareth is an arab town and Solomon was on good terms with everyone there. In fact, most of the area that we drove around was populated with Arabs.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Tabgah, where Jesus performed the miracle of the loaves and fishes. There is a beautiful little church built there to commemorate the event.</p>

</div>
<p>Also in Tabgah is the Church of the Primacy of Peter which is where Jesus appeared to the Apostles after his resurrection. In the middle of the church is the rock where Jesus told Peter that he was the rock on which to build the church. There are pictures on the wall of various Popes that have come to kiss the rock. This was the first place that, to me, felt like a "holy" site. There was something ethereal about this location above and beyond the other spots that we had visited so far. The grounds around the church are lush, well kept and rather beautiful compared to the desert-like landscape just beyond the church.</p>

<p>Our next stop was lunch. We stopped at a resort town along the Galilee called Tiberias. There were kids swimming in the water. We had a fish called "St. Peter's Fish" which comes from the Sea of Galilee. I later found out that it is a variety of tilapia.</p>
<p>Our final stop before heading home was at the Yardenet Baptism Site. This was supposedly the location where John the Baptist baptized Jesus Christ. No one knows for sure exactly where the event took place, but they know how many days Jesus walked from a certain location and have estimated that this must have been the place. In any case, it's a beautiful location. People still come to be baptized all the time. No one was there to be baptized the day I was there, but I included a picture from the internet of what it looks like when people are there.</p>

&quot;Masada & the Dead Sea&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/masada-dead-sea&quot;;&quot;<p>My second full day in Israel, I was on my own for the day again, so I signed up for another tour. This one was to Masada and the Dead Sea. There were seven tourists on this trip.</p>
<p>Masada is a mountain-top fortress built by King Herod around the 2nd century BC. It was also the final stronghold of the Jews of the Zealot sect who were the last remaining Jews in Israel against the Romans. This fortress was under siege for 2 years before the Romans were able to breach the walls. When the Romans arrived, they found that all but a couple of the inhabitants had committed suicide. This is where the phrase "better to die free than live a slave" came from. They suppose that the only survivors were left to tell the story of Masada because they were old women they would not be of use as slaves.</p>
<p>The fortress is 1300 feet up a pretty steep cliff. To get to the top, you could either hike up a snake trail (it takes about an hour) or take a cable car. Either way, it's not good for people afraid of heights. I hadn't really figured that part out until it was too late. But I smiled and didn't look down and was on top of the mountain in no time. The trip was fascinating and I couldn't possibly go into all the details of things we learned on the trip.</p>

<p>After Masada, we stopped for lunch and then went to the Dead Sea. It's called the Dead Sea because it's so full of salt and minerals that nothing can live in it. It's supposed to have healing powers and be great for your skin. You can splash around in the mud, but I skipped that and just went to the water. Our tour guide gave us a HUGE list of things to be afraid of about the Dead Sea: if you swallow any of the water, you could die; if the water gets in your eyes, it stings TERRIBLY; because you're so bouyant, it's difficult to move around in the water and you may PANIC and swallow water. At one point, I did get water in my eyes and it didn't sting THAT badly. And I did swallow some water and became paranoid that I was going to pass out later, but nothing happened. Mainly, I just floated around in the water. It was very relaxing and my skin did feel great afterwards. Also, in my dream I had before coming to Israel, we had visited the Dead Sea. Once I saw it in person, I realized it related to the dream.</p>
<p>On the way home, we stopped to take pictures of the caves where they found the Dead Sea Scrolls. I'm not going to try to describe their significance here. We also saw a few bedouin camps along the way. They are small tribes of people that live in the desert without many (if any) modern conveniences. And we saw a real Canaan Dog at one of the camps. Unfortunately, I was too slow with the camera to get a picture.</p>

&quot;Jerusalem&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/jerusalem&quot;;&quot;<p>Our trip to Jerusalem started with a visit to the Model of the Second Temple Period. This gives one a nice perspective on what Jerusalem looked like before the destruction of the temple by the Romans. The model covered all of Jerusalem in 1:25 scale. It helps get a bearing on what one is about to see.</p>

<p>We checked into our hotel, the David Citadel Hotel. It is gorgeous - one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at. Our room overlooked the pool, which I swam in once while we were there. We had a great view of the old city. One night, we woke up at around 10:30pm to the sound of sharp explosions. There was one loud "bang" and then a smattering of more. We assumed that it was gunfire. Then I went to look out our window and saw fireworks. It was part of a sound and light show over David's Citadel.</p>

<p>Since our first day in Jerusalem was only a half day, we did sightseeing on our own. We primarily walked around the markets, went to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and had Turkish coffee. We were lucky enough to meet a tour guide at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre named Jaliel. He seemed to know what he was talking about, so we decided to sign up with him for a tour the next day. I can't go into everything we saw and learned on the tour. It was amazing. We went to parts of the Via Dolorosa (which traces the 14 stations of the cross) that most other tour groups seemed to miss. We visited an Ethiopian monastery on the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. And everywhere we went, Jaliel exchanged hellos to the locals whether they were Greek Orthodox fathers or the local Arabs. He was an excellent tour guide.</p>

You could see the changes of the rocks in walls where they had been fortified by different periods, from Roman to Byzantine periods.</p>

<p>The first big stop on our tour was Gethsemane. There's a very beautiful church there called The Church of All Nations that has some of the most fanciful mosaics I've seen in a church. I was hoping to come back to the church later in the trip because it's the kind of place that you could stay for hours meditating, but unfortunately, there was never time to come back. I guess I'll have to wait for another trip to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>After Gethsemane, we walked to the Tomb of the Virgin where Mary is buried. Our guide, Jaliel, emphasized this by saying it twice, the actual tomb where the mother of Jesus Christ is buried. For some reason it felt tacky taking a picture of such a holy site, so I didn't. It's a beautiful church, though, and should be experienced. There was a line to walk into the actual tomb which can only fit about 3 people. I was able to see in and that was enough for me.</p>
<p>As we were outside the old city walls, Jaliel pointed out Golden Gate. It is currently bricked over so that no one can use it. The Golden (or Mercy) Gate appears in the legends of all three religions. An early Jewish tradition holds that it is through that gate that the Messiah will enter Jerusalem. According to Christian tradition, Jesus made made his last entry to Jerusalem through the Mercy Gate. The Muslims refer to it as the Gate of Mercy and believe it to be the gate referred to in the Koran, through which the just will pass on the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>After touring outside the old city walls, it was time to cross into Old Jerusalem. We came in via the Lion's Gate in the Muslim quarter. Our tour started at the first station of the Via Dolorosa and went in sequential order. Early on, my camera pooped out, so I don't have most of the pictures from this part of the trip. The Via Dolorosa follows every spot of Christ's steps leading to his crucifixion and burial. It starts with the Ecce Homo Arch where Pontius Pilate is said to have declared "Behold the Man". It actually starts with where he was condemned to death, but that is now a Muslim school.</p>

<p>It was around this time that my camera went kaput for the day. I was able to salvage it later at the hotel. Anyway, we saw the rest of the Via Dolorosa, Jesus' prison, where he stumbled, etc. We went onto the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and down through it. There's no way we would have seen even half of the things that we saw without our tour guide. He seemed to know everyone. A couple people on the street told us that we had a very good guide and I agree.</p>
<p>After the tour, we were exhausted. David took a nap and answered email. I went swimming in the hotel pool and read. I was able to get my camera functioning again and took other photos in Jerusalem on other days.</p>

&quot;Arab Markets&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/arab-markets&quot;;&quot;<p>Jerusalem is more than just the land of religious epiphanies. It is also full of the most cut-throat market owners I've ever seen. The shop keepers will do anything to get you in their store. You are constantly hounded as you walk down the streets of Jerusalem. They will even stand in front of you as your walking so that you can't pass quickly. We knew enough to ignore them, but they had some sneaky tactics. Several times we would ignore them and keep walking, and they would shout "excuse me!" after us as if to say, "how could you be so rude as to ignore me!"</p>

<p>At one point, David and I stopped for turkish coffee and baklava. At that point, we asked someone for directions to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. They boy that we asked turned out to plague us the entire trip. I came to dread seeing him. He was very helpful, but we ended up in his father's shop, which was actually pretty good. We did most of our souvenir shopping there. However, whenever he saw us for the rest of the trip, he would come over to us (or just me if I was alone), offer to buy us tea, and try to get us to go to his father's shop.</p>

&quot;The Church of the Holy Sepulchre&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/church-holy-sepulchre&quot;;&quot;<p>Out of everything we saw on the trip, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was by far my favorite. I went there three times: with David on our first day, with our tour guide Jaliel on the second day (and he took us some areas that we never would have found on our own), and at the end of our second day to visit the inside of Christ's Tomb. I could talk on and on about the church, but you should just go there and see it for yourself. It is divided up by six different denominations: the Greek Orthodox, the Armenians, the Franciscans, the Ethiopians, the Christian Arabs, and I think the Syrians have a section in there too. I forget.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I had a bit of a freak out when we first went to the church. It's hard to describe. I've grown up hearing and reading all these stories and all of a sudden I was staring at the hole in Golgotha where Christ's crucifix went and it stopped being some faraway story. I've written several sentences just now that I've deleted and decided that one's reaction to this church is very personal. I'm not going to describe what I felt, but I will say that it moved me very deeply every time I went. These pictures pale in comparison to what it's like experiencing the real thing.</p>

&quot;Bethlehem&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/bethlehem&quot;;&quot;<p>The morning of our last full day in Israel, I went to Bethlehem. This was a big deal for a few different reasons. First of all, it's the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Secondly, it was the place that I had a dream about several months prior to visitting it. And thirdly, it was in the West Bank under Palestinian control. Israeli tour guides are not allowed to go into the West Bank for security reasons, so if you want to go, you have to figure out how to get there. There are tours that go there, but I couldn't find any. You will occasionally hear someone on the street say that they are willing to take you to Bethlehem, but I don't want to go with a stranger for obvious reasons. Our tour guide from the Via Dolorosa, Jaliel, offered to take me, so I took him up on it. David did not go because he did not want to make himself a target to angry Palestinians. However, tourists have rarely, if ever, been a target for terrorism in Israel.</p>

<p>I met Jaliel in Old Jerusalem. He took me through into East Jerusalem, the muslim part of town, to get a shared taxi that would take us to the West Bank. A shared taxi fits between 10-20 people. It's a little bigger than a mini-van. I was quite obviously the only non-arab on the taxi. Although Bethlehem is only a 15 minute drive away from Jerusalem, we had to go through Israel checkpoints to get there and since the wall had been built, we had to use an indirect road to get into Bethlehem. Before the Israeli guard got on the bus to check passports, Jaliel asked me to NOT say that I was going to Bethlehem. He told me to say that we were visitting friends in Gosh Etsyon. He said that the guards don't like to hear that tourist are going to Bethlehem, but I think there was some other reason. Still, I was already nervous at that point and the thought of being told to lie to an Israeli guard in full military gear was not making me feel at ease. Luckily, the guard didn't ask. The shared taxi went on for a while and we got off at a non-descript stop in the street. There was no sign, no house, it just seemed like a dirt road. But we found a taxi right away that took us to Bethlehem where I met a certified Palestinian tour guide that took me to the Church of the Nativity.</p>
<p>And now on to the Church of the Nativity. First of all, it's the ONLY church in Israel that was not destroyed by the Syrians in the 6th century. When the Syrians came to destroy all the churches, they saw the mosaics in the Church of the Nativity and saw the wise men in Syrian dress and thought it was a Syrian church. Secondly, the visit to this church was right out of my dream. As soon as I saw the entrance to the church, I had a slight freak-out, because it was right out of my dream. You have to duck to go into the church to make you humble and to keep camels and horses out of the church.</p>

<p>The inside of the church is beautiful. Unfortunately, almost every photo I took came out incredibly blurry. I don't know if this is God's doing or Sony's. My guide took me down to the area where Christ was born. He said we only have a few minutes between the Catholic mass and the Armenian mass to visit the birthplace, which we did. Once again, I felt the vibrations of being in a holy location. It was incredible. And I had another moment of seeing something that was in my dream.</p>

<p>After visiting the church, we went back to a souvenir shop (whenever you have a tour guide, your tour will end up at a souvenir shop), I bought some things to support the local economy and had some mint tea. The Palestinians were extremely friendly and less pushy than I had been used to. I think they were a little beat down that tourism had come to a near standstill for the past five years. Most of the shops in the town were closed. Apparently, the Pope had come to bless that Church of the Nativity in 2000 and a bunch of people bought shops thinking that the Pope's visit would promote tourism. Then the Intifada started and everything came to a halt. It's quite sad. We got lucky on the way back in that we found an Israeli taxi that was willing to take us over the border and back to Jerusalem.</p>

&quot;Western Wall&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/western-wall&quot;;&quot;<p>The second half of our last full day in Israel was dedicated to the Western Wall. The Western Wall is the only remaining portion of the Temple Mount that King Herod built for the Jews. The Temple Mount was destroyed by the Romans. It is now the location of the muslim Dome of the Rock (where Muhammed left the earth to talk with God), and it is also supposedly the rock where Abraham was commanded to sacrifice Isaac, so you get to see the problems that people have about which group has more claim to the land than someone else. You almost expect to see a sign posted that says "No more religious epiphanies in this area, please". The Western Wall also functions as an open air synagogue. There are always people praying. I had that look of "easy convert" on my face and was approached twice by people trying to convert me to some particular sect of Judaism. All along the Western Wall, people write prayers on paper, fold them up, and place them in the cracks of the wall. Although it's most prevalent here, I saw this being done as far north as the Sea of Galilee.</p>

&quot;Farewell to Israel&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/farewell-israel&quot;;&quot;<p>WAAAH! I don't want to leave! Luckily, we had to get up at 2 am to catch a taxi to the airport, so I was too sleepy to get emotional about it. If you've ever thought about going to Israel, then GO! Don't put it off. These pictures are nothing compared to experiencing it firsthand. Now is a good time to go because there aren't a huge amount of tourists.</p>

<p>Getting through the Ben Gurion Airport was relatively painless. We got asked a lot of questions about the nature of our visit. We had to come out to the security guard interviewing us. She eventually asked me, "So. You've been living together for five years and this is your first visit to Israel? What took you so long?" We got into the airline lounge because we were flying business class. David knocked over the glass jar of candy at the front desk and it made a very large crash and shattered into a million pieces. Then I saw a very pushy man trying to be first on the plane and in his rush he tripped over luggage and did one of those slow motion falls where you repeatedly think he's going to catch himself but then eventually fell flat on his face. I was too tired to respond to all of this early morning slapstick, but once the coffee kicked in I was giggling all the way to Zurich about David knocking over the candies and this pushy man losing his dignity in front of everyone.</p>
<p>I can always tell if it's a good trip because I have no jet lag on the way there and I have a lot of jet lag when I come home. This was one of those trips.</p>&quot;;&quot;1125550800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Chiapas!&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/chiapas&quot;;&quot;David and I scheduled to take a tour with Maya Sites (http://www.mayasites.com) through the southern area of Mexico for the fall of 2005. Unfortunately, David took a trip of his own on 23rd street and broke his foot weeks before our vacation. So we postponed that trip and re-scheduled it with the same company for their "Festivals of the Highland Rainforest Maya". And I'm so glad that David broke his foot because this trip that we took instead was amazing!&quot;;&quot;1141192800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Villahermosa&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/villahermosa&quot;;&quot;<p>Our flight went from La Guardia in New York, to Mexico City, and then to Villahermosa. We left a lot of time in Mexico City since we had to go through customs. For some reason, we got through customs RIDICULOUSLY quickly and we were left with a long layover in the Mexico City airport. Unfortunately, it's not the best airport to get stuck in. Now that I know it a bit better, I would have found the one upscale area and spent some time shopping. We didn't know better at the time, though, and so we just hung out in the main waiting area. Time seemed to pass at an all-time slow. It didn't help that we had gotten up at something like 4 in the morning and the airport was not air conditioned. There's nothing like being tired, hot, and wearing warm clothes because you jsut left a place that's still in winter. We were also somewhat lucky to make the connection to Villahermosa. We had been listening carefully and heard the gate being called about 15 minutes prior to our flight taking off. We never saw a gate being posted on the electronic boards throughout the airport - even when we arrived at the gate. I think the locals that take that flight all the time know the gate. Anyway, the flight there was pleasant and uneventful.</p>
<p>We checked into our hotel and unwound. Our hotel was next to the Hyatt and I believe were the only two upscale hotels in that area. There's not much to see in Villahermosa other than the Olmec heads. We asked at the hotel for a good place for dinner. They (and the guidebook) suggested VIPS. I had a vague recollection of a VIPS in northern California. I thought they were more in the category of a Denny's than a nice restaurant. David double-checked and said something along the lines of "Are you sure it's a good restuarant?" The person at the hotel smiled and ensured us that it was a good restaurant. It turns out that I was right. Vips is a Mexican Denny's. We had to do some shopping first for bottled water and bug repellant, so we passed VIPS. We ended up eating a Sanbourne's which we suspect was better than VIPS - but who can tell. It was probably a toss-up.</p>

&quot;Bonampak / Yaxchilán&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/bonampak-yaxchil-n&quot;;&quot;<p>Today we had an early start. We met at 6:30 to visit all the stops. And it's a good thing, because we had some surprises later on the trip that delayed us for a few hours. We started off with about a 45 minute drive to lunch spot. I forgot to ask for the details of where we were, but looking back at the map now, I think we were at Rio Chancalá. It was a small tourist stop on the road with excellent homemade breakfasts under a thatched roof. There was a large German tour bus that stopped for breakfast at the same time we did.</p>

</div>
<p>After breakfast, we climbed aboard the van, hit the road, and...didn't get very far. 
About 15 minutes into the next section, the traffic all came to a stop. The local Mayans had blocked off the road as a protest to the government. And that is the only road that takes us from where we were to where we wanted to go. In fact, if it hadn't been for the Zapatista revolution, there wouldn't be a road at all because the government paved roads so that they can easily get the military into towns and control the locals. Our van driver went to talk to the locals. Apparently three men had died in a fight over land the day before. The locals had been asking the government to intervene for some time and put down clear ownership of the land. Our van happened to be stopped right in front of a house where they were holding a funeral for one of the deceased. There were women showing up in traditional Mayan dresses, followed by a lot of crying and singing, a small dingy white truck showed up and they loaded a casket onto the truck and drove off. The government made a big show - helicopters flew over head, police rode up, and then the military drove up in riot gear. It didn't make any difference. Each time a new group showed up, it looked like the protesters were going to leave, but they kept their ground. Our tour guide was clearly worried. We found out later that they have sometimes blocked the road for days without letting people through. Eventually they got some positive response from the government and they started letting people through. Our van driver was right, wait a couple hours and they'll let us through as long as we pay 200 pesos. And that's what happened.</p>
<p>So, we were back on the road to Bonampak. We had another hour and a half, I suppose, before we got there. Our tour guide said that the locals at Bonampak were one of the Mayan groups that had mostly given up their Mayan way of life and tried to survive on the tourist industry. Unfortunately, the tourist industry isn't enough to support them. They did not seem to be as healthy as the other Mayan groups that we had encountered up until that point who were poor, undoubtedly, but self-sufficient. The site of Bonampak was quite amazing. The murals are still quite colorful, but had clearly lost a lot of color over the past fifteen years (our tour guide had photos of what they used to look like). Once upon a time, they were covered by a dust that had preserved them, but when the archeologists uncovered the dust, the murals started fading. So run to Bonampak! These murals won't be around for long!</p>

<p>Next, it was back to the van and an hour drive to Yaxchilán. Since we were late getting to Yaxchilán from the road block, we skipped lunch and grabbed some snacks at a small store before getting on the boats to Yaxchilán. You cannot reach the ruins by car, you have to take a small boat to the ruins. It's about a 45 minute trip up the river.</p>

<p>The ruins at Yaxchilán are impressive. They weren't as monumental as Palenque, but there was some very dramatic sites. Also, since the site is so hard to get to, it's a lot less invaded by tourists. Our first stop was through a temple of the dead - which is a structure to honor the underworld. There wasn't a lot to see because it's primary function was to be completely dark on the inside. Even walking up to it, it felt as if we had walked into a set for an Indiana Jones movie. At the entrance, our guide pointed out some bats hanging from the ceiling. I went in last of our group since I was fiddling with the camera. As I walked in, I heard the guide say "There's a wolf spider on the wall. See that?" I didn't know what a wolf spider looked like, but I didn't really want to find out. I sort of instinctively took a few steps back outside and into the sunlight. I decided that I was being a wimp, so I started to walk back in (it was pitch black inside with the exception of the guide's flashlight). Then I heard our guide say "Wait. Where did it go?" I thought about not going back in. Wolf spiders sound bad enough. Jumping wolf spiders I can do without. I was comforted when I heard the guide say "that's not a very big wolf spider". I started to step back in and heard him say "Now <b>there's</b> a big wolf spider." Okay. We're now plural. And we had reached a large size. The part of me that has no interest in hanging out with large spiders said "Why do you want to hang out in a dark, cramped space with spiders? No thank you. And I stepped back out. Out in the sun, all fears of spiders left. I felt like an idiot. There were old women on our tour with more bravery than me. This was ridiculous. So I started to go back inside. And heard the guide say "See overhead? Those are vampire bats." At that point, I decided I was actually the <b>smart</b> one by hanging back. What do I benefit from hanging out with bats and spiders? I'll pass, thank you. And I happily waited outside for the group to finish. I asked David later how big the big wolf spider was. He said "Well it wasn't only a couple of inches tall." Sensing that he was leaving something out, I asked how long it was. "About this long": and he held up his hands to be about a foot long. I praised the part of my brain that told me to give up on a false sense of masculinity and just stay outside.</p>

<p>The tour of Yaxchilán was great. It was one of the highlights of the trip. There are some incredible temples at the top of hills. The reliefs were fascinating. Many of them featured blood-letting rituals. The women would pierce their tongues and run thorny vines through the hole. The king would pierce his foreskin. We also got some time walking through the jungle to some of the largely unexcavated areas of the ruins.</p>

<p>We walked through the jungle a bit and then took the boats back to main road. Our guide took us to the local cultural center that also acts as a restaurant in the evening. We were in a bit of hurry, because we wanted to get home before it got too dark. Mainly because people and dogs wander along the road. He said that he didn't want to hit any pigs on the way home, but we assumed he was saying "pigs" instead of "dogs" so as not to worry anyone. There were dogs walking all along the road all day. It's a miracle that we didn't hit any (thank God).</p>&quot;;&quot;1141192800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Palenque&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/palenque&quot;;&quot;<p>Today was our first real touring day, although it started off with a long car drive. We got up relateively early to prepare for the trip. A car was picking us up and taking us to Palenque to visit the ruins. We met two of our group - a young woman named Kelly from Washington D.C. and an older woman named Melanie from Sacramento. We made polite conversation, but it ran out quickly considering we didn't really know each other. It was about 2 and a half hours to Palenque. It was good to adjust oneself to the fact that we were in Mexico. That area was particularly lush and green. As we got closer to the ruins, our driver pointed them out from a distance. It was quite exciting to see how large they were from a distance.</p>
<p>There was some initial confusion when we first showed up at Palenque. Apparently, our tour guide had already started walking around the site with the three people that were part of our tour that were already in Palenque. So we met the rest of our group: a British couple named John and Teresa and a former Brit/current Norwegian Mike. They were on a several week tour of most of southern Mexico. This trip landed in the middle of their overall tour.</p>
<p>How to describe Palenque? Well, it's humungous. Not only are the ruins themselves quite large, but it's very extensive. There are also some 1,400 structures identified at Palenque. We only went through the most prominent ones - about eight of them. The tour was very thorough hitting everything from the ancient bathrooms, to how they built the wall, to the carvings. It's silly of me to try to go through every detail that we explored there, so I won't. Here are some photos.</p>

<p>After a few hours of walking the grounds, we went to a place about 15 minutes down the road for lunch. There was a small collection of restaurants and hotels called El Panchán. We ate at a restaurant called "Don Mucho's" and is owned by the brother of our tour guide. We later found out in our guide book that our tour guide's family is something of local royalty.</p>

<p>After lunch there was more exploration of the ruins at Palenque. We got more detail on Pakal's palace, walked through a tomb of an unidentified woman, and then headed off to the museum at Palenque to see some of the items that were taken out of the ruins and preserved. David and I kept hearing this loud occasional roaring from the forest just outside of the ruins. It was occasionally quite loud. It sounded as if someone had a special effects record of a roaring animal - like a jaguar or tiger. We didn't think much of it at the time because it did sound like it was coming from a stereo system, but a few days later at Yaxchilán, we asked someone and they told us that it was howler monkeys. I decided that if a single monkey could make that sound, I didn't want to run into that monkey.</p>

<p>After the museum, we checked into our hotel in Palenque where we'd be staying for the next three nights. The hotel was nice enough. We took a walk into the main part of Palenque after settling into the hotel and ate dinner in a restaurant off of the town square - which was hopping at night.</p>&quot;;&quot;1141192800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Tenosique&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/tenosique&quot;;&quot;<p>Today was our first "festival" day. We went to a town called Tenosique where they have been having this very bizarre festival for hundreds of years. It's a bit hard to describe. It takes place every Sunday starting in January and ends with lent. A few select people dress up as jaguars - they paint their body orange, use a Coke bottle to make black spots on their skin, and drape an actual jaguar pelt over their back. We got access to where some of those people were preparing to get some good pictures.</p>

<p>The majority of the participants dress up as someone called Cojo. They dress mostly in white, wrap banana leaves around their ankles, wear masks, capes, and hats with tall pointy leaves in them. Our guide said that the story that they're enacting is a little vague, but supposedly it has to do with Cojo drawing out the evil jaguar and taming it. I don't really know. He said that people generally think that the Cojo character represents a Spanish conquistador, but David pointed out that they look more like a giant ear of corn.</p>

<p>We waited along the street for the action to heat up. The Cojo characters have small boxes with holes in the top. They will come up to you, shake the box and grunt at you. This is a sign that they want you to drop a couple of pesos in the box. I learned early on that I should <b>not</b> pull all of my change out of my pocket and pick out one small coin in view of the person demanding money. They will not be satisfied with one measly peso! Several times, David went to buy a piece of candy and ask for change to give the Cojo people. It's sort of like Halloween. Most of the people dressed as Cojo are kids.</p>

<p>While we waited, a small kid (about 10) stopped by and started talking to us in very good English. His name was Alessio. He often came up to us later in the day to talk to us. He was holding something in his cape that David noticed a little later. A giant phallus. Our guide warned us that there were going to be some sexual/suggestive elements in the dance. I guess I wasn't expecting kids to be walking around with large phalluses. I tend to think he was hiding it in his cape when he talked to us because he knew we would think it was weird.</p>

<p>We hung out with a group preparing and then went into the festival. There's a moving dance that is somewhat controlled by a drummer and a flag waver. The dance moves very slowly through the town and stops to go through a dance cycle periodically. I couldn't figure out the stages of the dance, but the drummer would change the beat and everyone would slow down, scatter, form a circle, or speed up. </p>

<p>What makes the day REALLY fun is that while the dancing is going on, they throw flour at you or squirt you with water. For some reason, most of our group was pretty much left alone, but David and I were <b>pelted</b> with flour. I'm still cleaning flour out of my camera bag.</p>
<p>After following the dancing for a couple of hours, went to a restaurant for lunch. There were a couple of guitar players and singers that played for us while we waited for our food.</p>

<p>After lunch, we went back to festival. It had moved into the public square and was at full force. They upgraded their arsenal from simple fistfulls of flour to hollowed out eggs full of flour. I took one on my jaw that exploded all over David. I was trying to be a man about it, but it really hurt! Things were really chaotic by this point. We ran into Alessio and he was clearly exhausted. It was clear that young women were the targets of the flour. The prettier the girl, the more covered with flour she would be. David and I decided that we should be flattered that we were the only ones in our group to be targeted. After about a half hour, we got to the van and rode back to Palenque for a shower and a quiet dinner.</p>

Palenque is at an elevation of 80 meters (~260 ft) and San Cristóbal is at an elevation of 2160 meters (~7000 ft), so we had a ways to go. And it was, of course, a tiny, winding road. Although we were looking forward to getting out of the warm lowlands and head to more temperate weather in the mountians.</p>
<p>Our first stop was at a waterfall called Miso Ha. There was nothing particularly cultural or historical to see. The natural beauty of the falls spoke for itself. This is apparently one of the prime locations featured in the movie <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/locations">Predator</a>.</p>

<p>Our next stop was another set of waterfalls called Aqua Azul. There had been heavy rains the night before, so the falls were stronger than usual. Unfortunately, they were not blue - they were brown. We were reassured that they are normally quite blue. Oh well. We parked at the base and worked our way up the falls.</p>

<p>Our next big stop was a site of ruins on the way to San Cristóbal - Tonina. The ruins are built into a cliff, so there was a lot of climbing. The steps were so steep that it felt as if you were climbing a wall. Tonina is known for having very good reliefs about the capture of warriors and a tribute to the god of the underworld. I decided that I was going to brave the room of the dead - reagardless of spiders. Luckily, there were none.</p>

<p>After the ruins, we stopped at a place for homemade quesadillas and then drove the rest of the way to San Cristóbal. We noticed that most of the signs on the road had large holes in them. We all assumed that they were bullet holes, but our guide pointed out that the government drills holes in them because the locals steal the road signs to cook tortillas on. Drilling holes in them makes them useless as stovetops.</p>&quot;;&quot;1141192800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;San Juan Chamula&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/san-juan-chamula&quot;;&quot;<p>I'm going to put all of San Cristóbal on hold for a second and talk about what happened the next day because it was one of the most bizarre experiences I've ever encountered. We celebrated "Fat Tuesday" in a small mountain town called San Juan Chamula. Unfortunately, the one experience that is the most difficult to describe is the one place we were absolutely not allowed to take pictures. The locals strongly believe that it steals your soul. There were signs posted as we got to the main square saying "NO PHOTOS ALLOWED AFTER THIS POINT". There were men with sticks that would knock a camera out of your hand if you even lifted one up.</p>
<p>San Juan Chamula is a place that has mobined ancient Mayan religion with Catholicism. They have a modified crucifix that looks more like an ear of corn. David once heard that the Chamulans believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross to become the Sun God. They also highly prize Coca Cola because they believe the carbonation releases evil spirits and it's one of the few things they can't produce themselves. Their version of Fat Tuesday doesn't really resemble anything the Catholic church would endorse. They sacrifice bulls in the town square. The day is unbelievably chaotic and surreal. I will do my best to describe it, but this is something that has to be experienced.</p>
<p>Shortly after we arrived to town, our guide ran into a local guide named Chip who has been living in San Cristóbal for many years and knows the locals. He got us into the mayor's house for a special glimpse of the preparations. It was a small and relatively modest house. All along the walls were the male town elders - small, old men that did not talk. There was a man changing into white ceremonial clothes clsoer to the center. I saw only one woman there. She was attending to a shrine in the middle of the room. There was a huge amount of incense being burned and god only knows what else. The room was filled with smoke. There were candles everywhere and banners hanging from the ceiling. I would have liked to have stayed maybe a little longer, but I felt like I was intruding on their festival and I was concerned that I was inhaling something I would later regret. (I later found out that the locals often do hallucinogenic drugs as part of religious ceremonies).</p>
<p>We wandered up to the main square. There were people everywhere running around. We saw many older children dressed in brightly colored clothes wearing black pointed hats with red, yellow, and green streamers hanging from them. We later found out that the black hats were made from the skin of howler monkeys. Many of this kids had horns that played two very dissonant notes at once. Some of the kids had drums. Also in the town square, they were setting off extremely loud firecrackers. Our guide wanred us not to go near the firecrackers because sometimes they fire into the crowd. You could lose your hearing or worse.</p>
<p>After waiting in the public square for a bit, we went into the church. The church is especially sacred and no pictures are allowed. For a Catholic church, it was not ornate - well, not ornate in the way that one would expect. There were corn husks hanging from the walls. There were large banners strewn across the ceiling woven by the natives. There must have been thousands of candles throughout the church - on tables, on the floor, and along the wall. People would come in with candles, light a few, and simbply plant them into the stone floor and start praying. We saw some people praying fervently, bowing on their knees, and holding coke bottles up to their forehead as an offering to God (remember that they value Coke and they are preparing to give something up for Lent). All along the walls were glass cases with saints inside. The name of the saint was usually painted on the glass. All of the saints were ornately dressed and usually had a mirror hanging around their neck to ward off evil spirits. The saints looked more like large (some of them were almost life-size) porcelain dolls. Their faces had been painted to have disarming expressions. Some had a look of suffering, some looked like they had just seen God, some looked afraid, some looked at peace. Walking around the church and looking at the saints was one of the most bizarre experiences I've ever had in my life. They had an air of real people - I kept expecting to see one of the saints move - and yet the whole atmosphere was fantastical at the same time. Add to this the sound of the drums, dissonant horns blaring, firecrackers going off outside, and some sort of very strong incense. I stopped in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary (who had multi-colored chaser lights around her glass box) and meditated on what I was experiencing. I thought of places I had been where the barrier between this world and the next is very thin - like a veil that you can almost see through. I tried to "look through the veil" in this church and I saw chaos. I don't know how else to describe it.</p>
<p>Our group went back out to the main square. David and I decided to break off from the group and explore on our own. We could see something happening in the corner of the square. There were men in black lamb tunics. We saw them holding onto ropes. Occassionally, the crowd would shift and the kids would come running in our direction for a moment and then crowd back to where they came from. We eventually realized that they were dragging a bull into the town square with the rope. The bull would start charging and all the kids would run away for a second. Part of the "game" was for the teenage boys to jump onto the bull's back and ride it for a few seconds. They were slowly dragging the bull into the center of the square to sacrifice it. Along with the realization of what they were doing to this poor bull, I realized that I must have inhaled something along the way, because I started having mild hallucinogenic reactions - my perception was starting to go two dimensional and my jaw clenching. I told David that we should get out of here and have something to eat (we hadn't had lunch and it was past lunchtime). We found a place to have a coke and some churros. I felt a little better.</p>
<p>We wandered around a bit more. Luckily, we didn't see any of the bulls actually get sacrificed. They sacrifice five of them. It was explained to me why, but I can't remember it now. Our gruop eventually gathered up and went to a nearby textile town to see how the locals weave textiles by hand as they have done for thousands of years. The home where we went also made us some tortillas, but I was feeling quite out of it and passed.</p>

&quot;Na Bolom&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/na-bolom&quot;;&quot;<p>Our hotel in San Cristóbal was pretty incredible. We spent three nights at <a href="http://www.nabolom.org" target="_blank">Casa Na Bolom</a> which is a short walk from the center of town. Casa Na Bolom is a cultural center, a restaurant, a museum, a garden, a hotel, and a historical icon. All the rooms are individual and scattered throughout the estate, down hallways, across courtyards, up steps, etc. It's a huge area that I would stroll around and constantly find new little buildings or gardens hidden around a corner.</p>

&quot;San Cristóbal&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/san-crist-bal&quot;;&quot;<p>We spent two and a half days in San Cristóbal. It's a beautiful town to sit back and relax. The people couldn't be nicer and it's a blend of local culture and Western tourism. David and I had a great time just stroliing around the city. It's one of those places that didn't really get good until we exhausted all the major tourist destinations and just wandered around.</p>

  <div class="journalCaption">The street that we would walk down from Na Bolom to the center of town.</div>
</div>
<p>We loved the banners in the street and looked around for places to buy them. We went into at least 10 different stores asking for those banners and had the exact same story every time. David would ask for "banners" in Spanish ("banderas"). The clerk would look at him confused. David would describe them in Spanish. Eventually, they would understand what he was saying. Once they understood, David would ask them what they called them and they would nod that he was correct and say "banderas". No one ever carried them, but they always said that a paper store closer to the zocalo (town square). We tried what felt like every paper store in town and never had any luck. I later found them on 8th Avenue in New York just up the street from us.</p>
<p>One of David's favorite things to do in a Mexican city is to check out the local market. There's no possible way to capture everything that you see there - people holding onto a group of live chickens by the feet haggling over price, the fresh produce, the kids, etc. I was aware that we were in an area where they did not always appreciate photgraphs, so I took it easy. We ended up asking one man for a photo and paying him. David and I were on our own. We later found out that the rest of our group could not find anyone to consent to a photograph in the markets.</p>

<p>San Cristobal has beautiful churches. Unfortunately, the one really beautiful facade was under repair and surrounded in scaffolding. Oh well. Something to go back for. The interiors were beautiful as well, but often very dark.</p>

<p>Despite the pictures of the local spots, San Cristóbal is surprisingly "Western". There were great restaurants, hip hotels, streets without cars and lined with tourist trap shops, more internet cafes than you can shake a stick at, and good cafes. We found a great little dessert shop that we stopped at more than once after dinner to share a slice of cake.</p>

<p>Speaking of food stories, we went one night to a small steakhouse. I had been feeling not so great and was probably dehydrated. We ordered something simple - sopa azteca and a New York strip steak. David and I commented at how cheap the food is in Mexico. The food arrived, we ate. The waiter came back asking us what we wanted next. We said just the check. He left confused. Then the owner came over to our table to ask if everything was okay and why we didn't want to order more. We eventually realized that it was an "all you can eat" steakhouse and we were supposed to keep ordering more steak. We had severely under-estimated how good of a bargain our dinner was. Since we were full and had not been feeling so well, we assured them that the food was delicious but that we filled up and would take the check.</p>
<p>And, of course, it wouldn't be a trip abroad unless you ran across some New Yorkers. The day that we went to San Juan Chamula, we met the famle half of a couple that has a house right behind Casa Na Bolom where we were staying. Our last full day in San Cristobal, we went over to their house for coffee. We also met Chip there, the guide that had taken us to the mayor's house in San Juan Chamula. They are a couple that lives in New York most of the year, but vacation San Cristóbal and the Adirondacks. Small world!</p>

&quot;Cañón del Sumidero&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/ca-n-del-sumidero&quot;;&quot;<p>On our last day in San Cristóbal, we decided to get an early start, drive to Chiapa de Corzo, and take a tour of the Cañón del Sumidero before heading to Tuxtla Gutiérrez. It's a very striking canyon that you tour via speedboats that take you up the river to look at the dam and back. To get there, we took the most harrowing ride of my life.</p>
<p>We hired a local cab driver to take us to Tuxtla Gutiérrez and drop us off to see the Cañón del Sumidero for a couple of hours. Kidnappings or robberies of tourists has been on the rise, so I was a bit on edge to begin with. About 15 minutes into the trip, I realized that kidnapping was the least of my worries. I was far more likely to die in a car wreck, tumbling down the side of the mountain. Although they are building a super highway (two lanes in each direction!) from Tuxtla Gutiérrez to San Cristóbal, the road was only available for the last 15 minutes of the ride. The first part of the trip was on an <i>extremely</i> winding road along the edge of the mountain. Our cab driver was not in favor of waiting for anybody or anything. He did not slow down on curves, he sped up (I'm not joking!). If a large truck was moving slowly in front of us, he would pass the truck on a blind curve. At least twice he had misjudged passing a car in front of us and slammed on the brakes to avoid having a head-on collision with the car in front of us. Every 500 feet, there was another sign that read "CURVA PELIGRASO" (dangerous curves) or "NO MALTRATE LAS SENALES" (don't disregard the signs). There were small shrines along the side of the road of people that most likely had driven over the edge and down the edge of the mountain. I eventually tapped into my inner Buddha and told myself that if I was meant to die on the road to Tuxtla Gutiérrez, then so be it. It would at least be a quick death. Oh...and there were no seat belts in the car.</p>
<p>We made it to Chiapa de Corzo and immediately got on a bus for a tour of the Cañón del Sumidero. We kind of lucked out and got on a group that was primarily comprised of a bunch of middle-aged Mexican women touring together. Although they generally didn't speak English, they were a hoot. They had one American travelling with them - a retired gentlemen from Madison, Wisconsin, who had moved here so that his wife could be closer to her family. He had decided to tour with this group of women more because they were so much fun. They would cheer, take pictures of each other, and in general have a great time. The canyon was very impressive. The pictures don't do it justice.</p>

<p>In the middle of the canyon is a small cave that our boat drove up to. You cannot reach this area by land, you have to use a boat. There's a small ladder up to a ledge where shrine was built to the people that discovered the area and worked to keep the local wildlife protected.</p>

<p>We drove to the dam and instead of going right back to the spot that we left from, our driver took us to a small restaurant along the river for drinks and snacks. Unfortunately, we learned first hand the meaning of "tourist trap". It was obvious that our boat driver either owned the restaurant or was getting a lot of money from the owner for bringing tourists. We were in the middle of the river with no way to get out. Everyone ordered a full lunch. We were stuck in the restaurant for about an hour and a half. David and I started becoming worried because our cab driver had been told that it would be a two hour trip. It ended up being a four hour trip. On the plus side, there were a couple of cute parrots at the resturant that were very social.</p>

<p>We were very relieved to get back to our starting point and see our cab driver there and not overly pissed off that we took two hours longer than we originally thought. We went to Tuxtla Gutiérrez, had a nice lunch at the airport cafe, and headed on to Mexico City for the final portion of the trip.</p>&quot;;&quot;1141192800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Mexico City&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/mexico/mexico-city&quot;;&quot;<p>Aaah. Mexico City. More importantly, The Four Seasons Hotel. Rustic charm is nice, but a private and clean bathroom is a rare thing in a third world country. David and I arrived quite tired and there was a line to check in at the Four Seasons. I overheard some conversation that there was renovation going on during the day on the 6th floor, so I was prepared to not accept a room on the 5th, 6th, or 7th floors. When we got to the front desk, the clerk was taking a very long time to find a room. It was several minutes of watching her type into a keyboard and click her mouse repeatedly. She called over the manager and they clicked and stared at their screens for a while. I began to worry that they were going to downgrade us on the room, so I said "Is there a problem?" - which was intended to sound inquisitive and reassuring but David insists came out like acid. The manager said there was no problem and within a minute said that they had upgraded us to a nicer room on the 8th floor. Woo-hoo!</p>

<p>We were quite tired, so we ordered room service and hung out in the room the first night. The next day, we went to the antiques market. I started having my usual reaction to Mexico City - weak, bleary, short of breath, and unable to focus. I lasted a while at the market, but evenutally headed back to the room. We got a hand-painted offering box for the kitchen and David ended up getting about a dozen or so ex votos.</p>
<p>I have to admit that a lot of my visit to Mexico City is a poor-air-quality blur. We went to a couple of antique stores looking for more ex votos. We found out that they are easy to replicate and hard to authenticate, so most dealers don't carry them. Which is fine by us. They're cheap and look nice, so what's the big deal if they're replicas?</p>
<p>We had a wonderful evening with Pastor Luna, a colleague's of David that lives in Mexico City, and his wife, Anna Laura. They took us to a wonderful Italian restaurant in the hip and trendy part of town.</p>
<p>Our last full day in Mexico City, we went to the Franz Mayer Museum and took our time walking back to the hotel part of the way. We finally ate at a VIPS (remember from our first night) and it was all I dreamed it would be. The thing that always strikes me about Mexico City is that so many of the neighborhoods clearly had their big day once upon a time. We drove through a couple of pretty rundown neighborhoods that had fantastic architecture. I kept thinking that if there's ever an economic boom in Mexico, that Mexico City will be one of the most sought after cities in the world. </p>
<p>So, an incredible trip over all, but I was so happy at the thought of going back home, having a regular old salad and letting my digestive system recover. I suppose it's good that Mexico is only for true travelers. It seems so rare these days to go some place that is truly unspoiled. </p>&quot;;&quot;1141192800&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;London & Kent&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/england/london-kent&quot;;&quot;For some reason, David became concerned that he wasn't going to make platinum this year. He always operates under the assumption that he doesn't travel much. We planned a short week in London as an easy way to rack up some miles and figured we could see some shows, visit the countryside and bum around London.&quot;;&quot;1149570000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Arrival in London&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/england/arrival-london&quot;;&quot;<p>David and I took the day flight to London, as opposed to the red-eye, to help with jet lag. Our flight was around 8:30pm, it's about a 6 hour flight, and you arrive in London around 8:30pm. I can't think through the math right now to know if that's right. Perhaps I'm conditioned from many previous red-eye flights, but whenever I arrive in Europe, I'm exhausted. I don't know what it is about sitting on a plane for more than a few hours.</p>
<p>When we got to London, we took the Heathrow Express train (15 minutes from airport to London!) to Paddington Station. Our hotel was a 5-10 minute walk from the train station, which was much appreciated after a long flight.</p>
<p>It took us a few tries to get the hotel room right. The first room had a sink that didn't drain well and the towel rack came off when I tried to dry my hands. The second room was nice, but didn't have an internet connection. And the third room was just right. Goldilocks would have picked this room. I've learned not to expect much from British hotels, so was pleased that our hotel was somewhat spacious, clean, and was facing an inner courtyard.</p>
<p>After we settled in, we decided to go get something quick to eat. We passed several places on the walk to the hotel, so we headed back out. We ended up at a little place called "The Chicken Stop" and decided to get something and bring it back to the room. Most of the restaurants on the block were run by Arabs since that seemed to be the mode of the neighborhood. There was another man in "The Chicken Stop" that was talking to us about the wonders of fried chicken. He claimed that people made fun of him for drinking Diet Coke and then having fried chicken, but that he couldn't help himself because fried chicken is so delicious. He also recommended KFC.</p>
<p>We went back to the hotel room with our chicken, fries, and soda. We ate, finished unpacking, and went to bed.</p>
<p>There is nothing like that first night of jet lag to give you a good sleep. We slept about 10 hours - all of it wonderful.</p>
<p>We had decided that tomorrow would be all about Kent.</p>&quot;;&quot;1149570000&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;

The only drawback on taking the trains going south during the summer is that you're getting family beach crowds. We got stuck next to two loud groups on the train, but that didn't stop us from getting a little nap in on the way there.</para></p>

&quot;Alex & Sejal's Wedding&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/alex-sejals-wedding&quot;;&quot;On August 17th, David and I were lucky enough to attend the wedding of Sejal and Alex. Alex is one of David's colleagues at the hospital. He is of German descent. Sejal is of Indian descent. They agreed to have a traditional Hindu wedding at the Hyatt Regency on The Hudson in Jersey City.
<!--break-->

The ceremony was beautiful. They had handed out cards explaining all the parts of the ceremony which involved lighting a small fire, washing feet, flowers, blessings, and more. 

For some reason, I didn't bring my camera. I was kicking myself the entire time. So I grabbed my iPhone and tried to take some shots - some of which turned out okay.

The lunch and dinner were excellent. It was not your typical NYC Indian meal. The flavors were more unique and interesting. I don't know what kind of spices they used, but both David and I had vivid dreams that evening. In fact, David was shouting in his sleep and kicked me more than once.

&quot;Total Immersion Swimming Workshop&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/total-immersion-swimming-workshop&quot;;&quot;I have always wanted to be a better swimmer. I can manage to splash about and get somewhere when I need to, but I never really took to the water. A few years ago, I got a weekly swim instructor. He definitely helped, but I still felt like I struggled with the water a lot. And it was <em>exhausting</em>. I could only do a few short laps at a time without stopping to wheeze. I didn't know how people could swim lap after lap without stopping. A friend told me that I should learn to relax in the water and not try to swim so fast. Whenever I tried, I would sink, get water up my nose, etc. I only knew how to sprint in the water. I developed a routine of doing two freestyle laps and then a breast stroke on the third, because the breast stroke felt free and natural with lots of time to breath.

I read Terry Laughlin's <a href="http://www.totalimmersion.net/" target="_blank">Total Immersion Swimming</a>. While everything made sense, I just could not really apply the lessons to my swimming. First of all, you have to have someone that knows what they're doing help you get the right positions in the water. It's very much based on all sorts of body awareness that I just flat out don't have. Secondly, it's based on doing drills. And there are very few people that will sit down and do the drills required to really change your swimming. You need an instructor to force you to go through things systematically.

I saw that they offered workshops in Queens, but they emphasized bring a buddy since some of the class will be partner based. Somehow, I managed to talk Jeff into going with me. I was really excited about the workshop until I read someone's blog about attending the workshop in Queens. She said that both her and her husband took the workshop and were both triathletes. And most everyone in the workshop was a triathlete as well. Yikes! I am not a triathlete. I was intimidated to say the least. Plus, I had heard that they would be videotaping us in the water for review.

Anyway, Jeff and I went. The workshop started at 8am both days (Saturday and Sunday) and finished around 4pm. About the half the time was spent in the pool. Starting off was difficult - especially in the morning. The last thing you want to do at 8am is get into a cold pool. But once we got moving in the water there was a lot to concentrate on. And the constant movement warmed us up.

I could write pages about the things we learned in the workshop. The swimming technique really breaks everything down from the beginning. Some lessons came easier than others. There were a couple of times where I got quite frustrated with myself and the technique, but those moments were always followed an hour later with a big revelation and breakthrough. 

In the end, I got the amount of strokes it took me to cross the pool from 24 to 17! 

And though there were some triathletes in the class, it was not intimidating at all. Pretty much everyone was starting over learning the technique so it's not like there were some people that were perfect and some people were horrible. I didn't even mind the videotaping. On the final videotape review, I was actually looking forward to seeing how I did.

And most importantly, I now feel significantly more comfortable in the water. I have not yet made it back to the pool at the gym, though I have no anxiety about doing so. I have a list of things that I know I need to work on and look forward to doing so.&quot;;&quot;1223394337&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Photographic Lighting: Week 2&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/photographic-lighting-week-2&quot;;&quot;The first review of my homework for my photography lighting class went well. He gave me a specific challenge: to photograph objects instead of people. I clearly enjoy photographing people and he wanted us to start working outside of our comfort zone. 
<!--break-->

I also decided that I wanted to focus on indoor lighting where I control the light source. There was a person in our class that had done a great series of photographs of a sweet potato under various lighting sources. I wanted to recreate that look.

In trying to decide what object to use, I thought I would try for organic objects. But I have to admit that I was feeling a little uninspired just photographing plain old objects. I wanted to pick an object that was going to be fun. So I went to a comic book store and looked for action figures. I found a Magneto doll that was highly posable. Then I bought a bunch of produce. I thought it would be fun to photograph Magneto relating to produce with stark lighting.

The photos came out pretty closely to what I had envisioned. We'll see how they go over in class.

&quot;A Trip to Israel&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/trip-israel&quot;;&quot;In September of 2009, David was scheduled to speak in two conferences: one in Tel Aviv and one in Berlin. He asked me if I wanted to join him and I responded with jumping up and down shouting "ISRAEL ISRAEL ISRAEL!". <!--break--> Since he didn't have a lot of time, we went a few days before the conference to spend sometime together. Then after the conference, he went to Berlin and I stayed. A colleague of David's in Israel, Yoram Shapira, organized a trip to Jordan for me and a few other anesthesiologists and their spouses.

I had been to Israel only once before, and it was a very different trip. I visited mainly religious sites: Nazareth, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, etc. This trip was more about nature and archeology. It hit me just as hard as my first trip, but in a very different way. I think I must have lived in the Middle East in a past life. I took the desert so happily. Sure, I was ready for a week of rain by the time I got home, but my time in the desert was food for the soul.

I took 657 photos. It's taking me a long time to go through them all. So please come back every week or so to see the updates. Don't stop checking until you see the dramatic conclusion to my trip in Jerusalem!&quot;;&quot;1223731308&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Ein Gedi&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/ein-gedi&quot;;&quot;On our first day in Israel, we rented a car at the airport and drove to the Ein Gedi Kibbutz on the Dead Sea.<!--break-->

The flight to Israel was not as bad as we expected. We flew El Al on an overnight flight (coach, no less!). There was someone sleeping in between us. Luckily it was a small female that was probably on a "birth right" trip. The GPS device in the car wasn't going to take us the way we wanted to go - which drove a little bit through the West Bank. But everyone in Israel goes that way. The GPS route would have added an hour and a half to the trip.

As is typical with traveling east, the room wasn't ready when we arrived. We wandered through the garden like zombies until the room was ready.

The plus side on a trip to the desert is that in the first few days of jet lag, you'll be wide awake for the early hours of the day when it's cool. So our first day, we went to Ein Gedi - which is a natural spring. There's a kibbutz near there where we stayed. And there's a spa on the Dead Sea that is run by the kibbutz.

We arrived at Ein Gedi as soon as it opened. David politely said "You are wearing your hat and drinking 2 liters of water on this trip because I'm not carrying you back to the car when you faint from heat exhaustion." Thank you for caring, David.

Along the walk were little prairie-dog like animals called Hyrax (Hyraxes? Hyraxi?") They loved to sun themselves and climb the trees to eat the leaves. I don't know how they got so pudgy on a vegetarian diet. There were also Ibex (Ibexes? Ibexi?) - which were deer-like animals grazing for grass. Neither of the animals seemed bothered in the least by people.

Along the walk were occasional pools caused by the waterfalls. We stopped at one that was empty for a swim break. The water was pretty warm for a natural spring. It was only 9am by the time we got to the first pool and it was already extremely warm, so the water felt great. 

At the top of the walk is the main attraction: a very big waterfall (I think called David's Waterfall). We got there just before the tourists descended upon us. 

There was more that we could have hiked up to see, but we weren't feeling that adventurous so we headed back to the car. A two minutes drive from Ein Gedi is a site of an ancient synagogue called, appropriately, The Old Synagogue. There's a tent covering the ruins where you can see some very well preserved mosaics. 

After Ein Gedi, we went back to the room and napped.

&quot;Kibbutz Ein Gedi&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/kibbutz-ein-gedi&quot;;&quot;David and I stayed in Kibbutz Ein Gedi for 2 nights (or was it 3?). It's a great location for a total retreat. From there, we were able to go to Ein Gedi (the spring) and the Ein Gedi Spa (for mud baths, the Dead Sea, massages). <!--break-->

Our room was very private. I never heard anyone around our area of the grounds. The closer you got to the pool, the more you would hear kids playing. There were certain times of day when the pool was packed with kids, but there were also times when I had the place almost to myself. And it was so hot there, that just about any time of day was a good time to go to the pool.

David Reich, who usually does not get wet at all, was a water fiend. He went swimming in the natural pools of Ein Gedi, he stuck his head in the waterfalls, he swam in the Dead Sea, and went in the kibbutz pool several times. It was like living with a labrador retriever!

When we checked in, David asked if they had any special rooms available. They gave us the honeymoon room. I think the only thing that made it "honeymoonish" was a large jacuzzi for two. We spent so much time in water that it seemed silly to take a bath. So it went unused.

The grounds of the kibbutz were beautiful. At first glance, they seemed dry and lifeless, but as I wandered around (early in the morning as opposed to the heat of mid-day) I saw a huge variety of cactus life. There was a 7:30am tour that you could take of the gardens, but we didn't want to commit to any times - especially so early in the morning.

For food, they had a big cafeteria that served breakfast and dinner - buffet style. The food was surprisingly good - especially considering that it was kosher.

&quot;Photographic Lighting: Week 3&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/photographic-lighting-week-3&quot;;&quot;The third week of photography lighting class, we worked on beauty lighting. We set up two stations with a tripod and a strobe light. We later added umbrellas to the mix to see how that affected things.

The teacher really made the class this week. Our group was having fun taking photos, checking the exposures, etc. We had all adopted the habit of counting 3..2..1 before taking the picture. The instructor came over and said "Something is very wrong here! Can anyone tell me what it is?" We all shrugged in silence. He said "This light is at eye level. It's boring! I want excitement! Drama!" and he moved the light up. He told us to stop counting down. He grabbed someone's camera and started making banter with the subject, taking various photos. He basically infused a whole bunch of adventure into our rather boring photo session. After he left to go back to the other group, we got continually more creative. Standing on seats, crazy poses, and playing with reflectors. He came back later to infuse some more creative chaos later.

I've included my favorites of the portraits that I took.

I've also included my favorites from my homework. I wanted to explore photographing food. I had done some research and several people suggested not getting fancy with lighting food. Natural light is generally best. I went a photographic store and bought a light reflector (for capturing as much natural light as possible) and I went to The Cupcake Cafe to get a small cake as a subject. I took these photos at noon, to try to get as much natural light as possible. Unfortunately, my subject started sweating half-way through the session. Still, I like the photos. Half of the photos use the reflector and half just use the single light source of the sun.

&quot;Too Many Coffee Shops&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/too-many-coffee-shops&quot;;&quot;Many years ago, I complained regular to anyone who would listen about the horrible state of espresso drinks in New York City. You only had a few choices: Starbucks, Your Local Deli, and restaurants. There were a few places in the village or Little Italy where you could maybe get a decent espresso, but you couldn't count on getting the good barrista on any given day - and without a good operator, you can only go so far. 

I was so vocal about it, that someone forwarded me an article about why the espresso will never be good in NYC (the water has low calcium content) and the author's efforts to find a decent cup of espresso. He had the same comments I had - maybe your could find a good one here and there, but eventually the work would be handed off to a newbie barrista and the skill would be lost.

This past week, I noticed that things have changed. The city is turning into Seattle. There are quaint little mom-and-pa coffee places everywhere now. There used to not be any local coffee choices in my neighborhood, now there are two great ones within a couple of blocks: Grumpy's Cafe and Irving Coffee Company. Then, just yesterday, I saw them putting up a new independent coffee place on Greenwich:

Hallelujah. The Starbuck's locations are dwindling and these independent cafes are on the rise. Finally. Now maybe we can start thinking about adding bookstores back to the city.

&quot;The First Visit to the Dead Sea&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/first-visit-dead-sea&quot;;&quot;While we stayed at Ein Gedi, we took a trip to the spa. The spa had all sorts of treatments that you could get: mud treatments, ayurvedic massages, swedish massages, hot stone therapy, you name it. I got an ayurvedic massage and David got a mud massage. There were plenty of things to do if you didn't want to get a treatment. You could hang out at their big, blue pool; you could take trip down to the Dead Sea and go swimming; you could give yourself a mud treatment; or, you could stay indoors and hang out in the Dead Sea waters (they had piped up the water from the sea).
<!--break-->
David and I took a trip down the Dead Sea itself. It's not something you can do for very long. If you have any open sores, you'll feel them burn a little due to the minerals in the water. David didn't last that long. He said his whole system starts to get agitated by the water. You can see in the photos that the floor of the sea is like walking on solid salt. There's also a photo of a wooden pole that was placed in the water and the culture of minerals that has grown on it.

I didn't take any photos of the spa until the last half hour. I decided to leave my camera in the locker and just experience the spa for a while. But my massage finished a half hour sooner than David's, so I grabbed my camera to take pictures of the water, the lifeguard, and people in mud.

&quot;The Negev Desert&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/negev-desert&quot;;&quot;After getting acclimated to Israel, we left the Ein Gedi Kibbutz and headed to Be'er Sheva. It's a major city located in the Negev Desert. David drove us up the cliffs of the Dead Sea to the desert. It was a bit of a culture shock. There were large stretches of barrenness with an occasional Bedouin village. I was not a fan of the Negev desert on our first day.

We checked into our hotel in Be'er Sheva, relaxed a bit, and got ready for dinner. We went to a suburb to have dinner with Yoram Shapira, chairman of the hospital in Be'er Sheva. His backyard had a great garden with all sorts of fruit bearing plants. The patio was covered by an arbor with grapes that he uses to make his own wine. We got a tour of the basement where we saw his process for making wine - every step entirely by hand.

The next day, he took us around some areas of the Negev Desert. What I had originally thought was a barren landscape came alive. Yoram showed us how they had created areas of the desert to collect rainwater (there are only a couple of inches of rain per year) and build small groves of trees. They had imported various types of trees that could survive the arid landscape.

Our first stop was Ein Avdat National Park. It's a wadi (a canyon formed by a spring) near the home of [w:Ben Gurion], who David had described as the George Washington of Israel. We walked through the canyon to the source of the river (which was very small). Along the way, we saw many Ibex. They were not shy around humans at all. We got very close and if we came up on any on the path, they did not stop what they were doing.

After our canyon visit, we went to [w:Mitzpe Ramon] - the site of the largest crater in Israel. It's hard to capture the expanse of the crater in a photo. My wide angle lens couldn't take it all in - and you still don't get a sense of how deep the crater is.

I felt like the day was a great introduction to the Negev. I could myself returning someday. And honestly, even though it was extremely hot, it didn't bother me really. I guess I got used to wearing a hat and drinking a lot of water.

It's a hard show to describe. It helps if you've seen the movie Paris is Burning, since that's kind of the source material. It's essentially a fictional account of a "family" of drag queens competing at a ball in Harlem. There's dancing, singing, performance art, snappy dialogue, high drama, and lots of fantastic drag outfits. And this are not your silly, campy drag queens. These are your hard-code, tough-as-nails, steal-your-credit-card-so-they-can-buy-a-versace-outfit drag queens.

It's playing until November 16th. It's been extended twice. I hope it gets extended again. It's the sort of show that should reach a wider audience.

&quot;Photographic Lighting: Week 5&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/photographic-lighting-week-5&quot;;&quot;I missed the 4th week of photography class, so I'll jump right into week 5. 

This week in class, we started using soft boxes - which are big boxes of fabric you put over a light to direct all the light in one direction. There's a flat white part where the light emits, which diffuses the light. 

After we had gotten the hang of taking photos with the lights, the instructor came over and told us to start playing with the edge of the light. Essentially, this means positioning the soft box so that the light is not focused (in the least) on the subject. You end of just catching the edge of the soft box light on the subject. It was a really nice effect.

For our homework, we were to focus on subjects in motion - either capturing blur in the photo or stopping action in progress. This turned out to be very difficult for me. I spent an afternoon at Union Square. It turns out this wasn't so smart. It was midday, and in order to take a blurry shot, I had to use a long shutter speed. There was too much natural light to pull it off. I went to the dog run hoping to catch some dogs playing, but all the dogs were sitting serenely at their owner's sides. I looked for skateboarders, but there was only one. I got a couple of shots for class anyway, but I threw away the vast majority of photos I took.

I also tried an evening photo shoot of Kevin lighting a cigarette. It didn't come out at all like I thought. I thought I was going to get these great streaks of light. It didn't happen. I was happy with one of the photos none-the-less, but not because it was a great example of motion photography.

&quot;Caesarea&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/caesarea&quot;;&quot;I had the fortune of going to [w:Caesarea] two days in a row. The first visit was with David and our friend, Idit. She had decided to take us there to see some new films and exhibits that had been installed there and for lunch. She had been married at Caesarea, so it holds a special place in her heart.

We saw some of the new exhibits and films about the area. They gave an excellent slice of history about the area and also gave you a sense of how huge the original location must have been. We were commenting after the exhibits how many people had come through and laid claim to the area over the past few thousand years. What's next or Caesarea? Does it stay in Jewish hands from now until forever? Will they have to update the films someday to talk about how the Martians landed there and took it for themselves? It's definitely a location that inspires to think about the passage of time in a grand scale.

Idit treated us to a wonderful lunch on the water, watching fishermen out on the ancient remains of the rampart walls.

The next day, I took a tour from the hotel that went up the western coast of Israel. Our first stop was Caesarea, but we saw a different side. We visited the stadium where a flautist was showing off the incredible acoustics. We saw the arena where they held chariot races. Overall, I don't think we were there more than an hour - and it's a huge site - so I'm glad I had some time during the preceding day to enjoy the site.

&quot;The Baha'i Temple Gardens&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/bahai-temple-gardens&quot;;&quot;Our second stop on my organized tour was to the [w:Baha'i] Temple Gardens in Haifa. I thought we were going to have more time in Haifa - which is considered by many to the most beautiful city in Israel. We only had about twenty minutes, which was disappointing. They droves us to the top of the gardens, let us out to take pictures, then we drove off to the next stop. Bummer - but at least I was able to see some of the gardens.

One of the major tenets of the Baha'i Faith is on making things that are beautiful. The gardens are meticulous and well manicured. You are only allowed in the gardens if you are a member of the faith. Hence, all of these shots are taken from roughly the same - at the top overlooking the wall of the garden.

Someday, I hope to see more of the garden.

&quot;Photographic Lighting: Week 6&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/photographic-lighting-week-6&quot;;&quot;I'm a bit behind on my posts about photography class. Week 6 was all about black and white photography. I was hoping to bring in some male nudes, but all of my friends were shockingly prudish! I'm trying to figure out if that's because in the age of the internet, people just don't want someone to take nude photos of them. Or perhaps none of my friends trust me. Or perhaps the younger generation just isn't as comfortable stripping for art. Hmmm...

So instead I went to [w:Abingdon Square] in New York City. People had donated several carved pumpkins to the square for Halloween. They made great subjects.

I also finally learned to use my new on-camera flash successfully. It's wireless, so I was using one hand to hold and angle the flash. I exposed the camera without the flash first, to get a very underexposed shot of the background, then used the flash to make the pumpkin take the focus. I think the effect worked.

Since I was shooting RAW, I converted the images to black and white using Aperture. They have a tool called "Monochrome Mixer" that helps you convert images to black and white. You can assign each RGB value a different percentage of the total black and white. So, for instance, if you want the green values to be more dominant, you would mix the image to weigh the green values more heavily in the black and white image. This allowed me to make sure the pumpkins stood out more, by mixing the image for an "orange" filter.

&quot;Photographic Lighting: Week 7&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/photographic-lighting-week-7&quot;;&quot;This week, our assignment for class was to photograph food. He gave us the general guideline of using natural light in the background and a reflector in the front to capture the light. I think I did pretty well at getting the subject to really pop with the reflector. I took some shots without the reflector for comparison and they came out a little too contrast-y - and not in a good way. The reflector gave the food a nice glow to it.

&quot;Acre&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/acre&quot;;&quot;The main event of our tour was [w:Acre, Israel]. It's an ancient city several layers deep. Like many of the sites in Israel, it's had many different rules at different times: Greeks & Romans, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, etc. The British used it as a prison for a while. There are several layers to the city, meaning that underneath the main city, they discovered a temple. And underneath that temple that discovered an older temple. They are still digging and finding more levels underneath what they've already found. 

Some of the pictures include a view of Knight's Hall. There's evidence that the French ruled during the building of it because there's a fleur-de-lis engraved into a column. 

Off of the Knight's Hall is a small passage that was originally built for royalty to escape the fortress. The passage gets steadily smaller until it empties out into the graveyard. It all felt very "Da Vinci Code". 

After touring the ruins, we stopped into a shop that sold copper and silver plates. The designs were quite impressive - better than the usual gift shop fare. They didn't want me taking photos, though.

We passed by a mosque on the way out, but we didn't go in.

&quot;Rosh Hanikra&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/israel/rosh-hanikra&quot;;&quot;Our final stop on our day tour is a locale at the very northern tip of Israel: the [w:Rosh HaNikra grottoes]. You take a small tram down the side of a cliff to get to the grottoes. The cliffs are a beautiful white chalk and the Mediterranean feeds into the grottoes, making for great tourist photos. <!--break-->

Rosh Hanikra was the site where Israeli and Lebanese officials negotiated and concluded an armistice in 1949 which ended the Lebanese-Israeli component of the 1948 War of Israeli Independence.

You're essentially at the border of Lebanon. So I took a photo.

&quot;Photographic Lighting: Final Class&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/photography/photographic-lighting-final-class&quot;;&quot;We had our final photography lighting class. The assignment was quite open ended: 

<blockquote>
EVOKE AN EMOTION
 
It is now time to take all that you have learned up to this point and put it together into strong evocative images. Images that show you can control the mood and voice in your lighting technique.
</blockquote>

No pressure. 

I went through many iterations of ideas for images. I had to immediately rule out spontaneous photos since that's not really about lighting. I had to think of images that were pre-meditated and planned. I had a few ideas here and there, but nothing that stuck. I went to see Slumdog Millionaire and fell totally in love with it. Every single shot was breathtaking and felt quite "real". However, it left me even more frozen as what to do.

In the end, I tried to recreate an idea I had while trying to fall asleep in Amsterdam. I thought of someone being visited by hypnagogic images of figures while unable to fall asleep.

I invited some friends over for dinner and the photo shoot, rented some lights, bought some animal masks, and we had a good time. I honestly could not tell if the photos were interesting or weird in a sort of bad-undergraduate way. In the end I was quite happy with them. They certainly stood out as different, which counts for a lot, I think. And the teacher really liked them. So Mission Accomplished.

For the rest of the class, we focused on taking shots of products - meaning wine, fruit, and cheese. 

Also in the set are some photos I had taken in the previous class.

&quot;Gogo at Christmas&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/gogo/gogo-christmas&quot;;&quot;I had been looking for this photo to show Mom while she was in town and I didn't have it handy. But now here it is: Gogo at Christmas. This was done a few years ago when David and I went to St John and left Gogo at a kennel. They dressed her up in a Christmas collar and somehow convinced her to smile for the camera. Though I don't approve of dressing up dogs for photos, this will go down as one of my favorite Gogo photos.

&quot;The House Tour&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/house/house-tour&quot;;&quot;If you want a virtual tour of the house, this is the place to start.

When we bought it, it was the Bowery Mission Women's Home. Even though it's been privately owned for 8 years now, we still occasionally get visitors to the house hoping that it's still a mission home. Sad, I know.

You can start with the pictures of what the house looked like before we got it, and then move on to the finished product. And one of these days, I'll take new photos of what it looks like now.&quot;;&quot;1229875359&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The First Round of Renovations&quot;;&quot;personal/house/first-renovation&quot;;&quot;The first renovation included the kitchen (since the only kitchen is in Benji's unit), the living room, and one of the bathrooms. 

Luckily, my sister planned to get married in our house that summer. She would often stop by, talk to the workers, and remind them that she was getting married there. It helped keep the project on track. We didn't have counter tops in time for the wedding, but Dad went down to the local lumber yard (yes, NYC has lumber yards) and had some plywood cut to fit and we placed table cloths over it. All in all, we were shockingly ready for the wedding.

During this renovation, our only kitchen was on the top floor. We had a hot plate, a microwave, and a mini-fridge on the top floor. And we only had one bathroom which we shared with the construction crew. Looking back on it, I don't know how we managed during this phase of construction. I had taken the attitude that it might never end and we could live like this for our entire lives. I was then pleasantly surprised when it was all done.&quot;;&quot;1229875876&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Last(?) Big Renovation&quot;;&quot;personal/house/last-big-renovation&quot;;&quot;One of the last big renovations was the Bollywood Room and my office. As I'm sitting here writing this, it's hard to believe that this room sat full of junk for years. It's hard to remember that the carpet was ripped up by the door from Gogo trying to escape. It feels like my own personal cave. I never want to leave.

So, after give tours of the house and listening to everyone <em>rave</em> about the X-Men Bathroom, David decided to trust me on my plan for a Bollywood Room. Not because he liked the idea, but because he would do anything to stop people gushing about the X-Men Bathroom. I think he realized that the Bollywood Room had the potential to be the coolest room in the house.

It's close...but there's no beating the X-Men Bathroom. No Way.&quot;;&quot;1229876398&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Christmas in Ithaca&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/christmas-ithaca&quot;;&quot;This year, Sis and I are both in New York, so we got to spend Christmas together. She came down for Thanksgiving, so we decided it would be appropriate if we came up for Christmas. 

I think this was Lorenz's first Christmas that he had some awareness of what it was and that he was getting presents. I thought for sure that he would not be able to wait opening his presents, but Sis explained several times to him the schedule that presents are opened after breakfast on Christmas morning, and he was cool with it. In fact, he didn't really understand that he was getting a bunch of stuff until he was about half way through the present unwrapping.

I had a hard time picking out a gift. Sis had various criteria. She would prefer a gift that was nurturing, designed to spark the intellect, and preferably had animals - and more specifically whales. I ignored all that and got him three Playmobil dinosaur sets. I have to admit - they were super cool. There was one set with a car and people, and the car had a big cage on wheels that you could tow behind that had a velociraptor in it. Super neat. And another set had a Triceratops, a baby triceratops, and they all lived in a volcano that you could explode with a button. Oh my god. I get excited every time I think about it. 

Lorenz took a bit to get really excited about it. That was partly due to the fact that there was a lot of assembly involved. David tried to act like he was put out by doing so much assembly, but the truth is that as soon as he saw all the little pieces and an instruction book, he seized them all and made himself a little workstation - all the while complaining about how much work it was. 

After present time, we got in the car to go see a movie. We drove about 30 minutes out of town to see Bolt, but it turns out the web had lied and that the theater was not open and if it was open on Christmas, Bolt wasn't playing. I realized that we had worked so hard to get Lorenz excited about the movie in order to leave his new toys behind, that we had another crushing disappointment on our hands. So we went back to Ithaca and saw "The Tale of Desperaux", which he liked. He's all business when he watches movies and is extremely well behaved. They had a photo booth in the movie theater which we used for great hilarity.

For dinner that evening, we made a delicious Mexican dinner - Sopa Azteca and Mushroom/Spinach Enchiladas. It was so good, I made a variation a week later when David and I were back in New York. For dessert, I had made a pumpkin tart. It was good, but a little too sweet and dense. I'll have to look for a recipe that lightens everything up.

The next morning, I was anxious to take some shots of the great outdoors. We had seen some great views of frozen waterfalls on the way up. So we all went to Buttermilk Falls and Ithaca Falls. The former was a bit of disappointment because instead of looking grandiose it just looked dirty. I think the best time for shots of the waterfalls is during the spring when all the snow from winter is melting.

This year actually had put me back in the Christmas spirit. I have been a real scrooge in recent years. I'm just not that into Christmas. But the winter drive to upstate New York, hanging out with Sis in her collegiate apartment, and seeing Christmas through the eyes of a 3-year-old renewed my faith in the holiday.

&quot;New Year Resolutions&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/learning/new-year-resolutions&quot;;&quot;It's time for New Year's Resolutions! I usually don't do New Year's resolutions - I do vacation resolutions. It's on a trip that my head clears and I have some time to think about what I'd like to change in my life. This year, though, for some reason, I have a ton of New Year's resolutions. And I have to admit, I'm pretty excited by them.

<strong>1. Be narcissistic.</strong>
I originally twittered this as a joke. But I followed it for a couple of weeks, and I realized how much I needle myself with negative comments and discredited myself. I need a regular, healthy dose of self-love. Like an internal cheerleader. In theory, if I follow this one to its fullest, I can forget all other resolutions.

<strong>2. Cook more dinners at home</strong>
David specifically requested this one. I made a great Mexican vegetarian dinner and it was like the old days when I would have a nice home-cooked meal most nights. I don't know how I got so far off the path of home-cooked meals. 

I think one of the hardest things for me is coming up with ideas for dinner, and then getting the shopping done in time. So I've developed a plan of coming up with a rotating one-month menu. On Friday night, I'll put together the grocery list for next week's food. That way, I don't have to think about what the individual dinners are - I just follow the monthly plan. The plan can always change - but it helps if there's a plan to start with. That also helps me make sure I'm not repeating foods too frequently.

<strong>3. Spend some time at The Tibet House</strong>
I really think group meditation could be a really good thing. And it's something to get me out of the house. I've talked about doing this for years - and I actually went there with my friend Sara once. The place is beautiful and the people were as friendly as could be. I think a regular dose of group meditation is the sort of thing that would help me stick with all of the other resolutions. And help me not be so crabby.

<strong>4. Do photo shoots around the city</strong>
Specifically: start reading Time Out New York for odd things around the city, go to the events, and take photos. The Brooklyn Cop had told me a story about a Santa Claus Pub Crawl where there were hundreds of people dressed in Santa costumes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. Why was I not there taking pictures? I have no idea where any of this would lead, but it would be fun and make me a better photographer. And if I could sell some of the photos someday, that would be great.

<strong>5. Write at least one play - preferably two.</strong>
The candidates are "Gay Men Behaving Badly" and "Randy & Sheila's Guide to Extramarital Relationships".

<strong>6. Swim at least once a week</strong>
No explanation necessary here. I love swimming. It's good exercise. I have time for it. It's a no-brainer.

<strong>7. Get over my fear of social swing dancing</strong>
It's time to just bite the bullet and start going to Tuesday night dance practice and Frim Fram on Thursday nights. No ifs ands or buts. Once again, it's good exercise, it's fun. No brainer.

<strong>8. Take Tai Chi lessons</strong>
We're starting to get into the dregs of resolutions. I doubt this one will happen - but it's definitely something I'd like to do.

Strangely, I have no tech aspirations.

There's a lot more there than I thought. It's all do-able - and if I were to accomplish all of that, I would be the happiest boy in the world. &quot;;&quot;1231089674&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Shortcrust Dough&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/desserts/shortcrust-dough&quot;;&quot;This dough has a higher butter and sugar content than a classic flaky dough, resulting in a sweet, crisp, yet crumbly tart shell reminiscent of a butter cookie (known as pâte sablée in France or pasta frolla in Italy).
<!--break-->
Taken from Cindy Mushet's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Desserts-Mediterranean-Flavors-California-Style/dp/0684800543/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231776370&sr=8-5" target="_blank">Desserts: Mediterranean Flavors, California Style</a>

Yields: enough dough to line a tart pan up to 10 inches in diameter

EQUIPMENT AND ADVANCE PREPARATION: 
One 9-or 9 1/2-inch fluted tart pan with removable bottom 
A piece of heavy-duty foil and enough pie weights to fill the tart shell to the top for prebaking 
Rice and/or dried beans may be used instead of metal pie weights, but note that rice and beans used in this manner are no longer suitable for eating (though they may be used over and over again to prebake tart shells).

INGREDIENTS:
1 1/4 cups (6 1/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
1/4 cup (3/4 ounces) sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 stick (4 ounces) cold (not frozen) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 large egg yolks
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 to 3 teaspoons water (as needed)

To mix using a mixer: Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low for 1 minute to blend the ingredients. Add the butter pieces and mix on medium speed just until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, about 3 to 4 minutes. In a separate bowl, whisk together the yolks, vanilla, and 1 teaspoon of water. Add this to the dry ingredients and blend just until the dough begins to form large clumps. Test the dough by squeezing several clumps in your hand-they should hold together. If not, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough coheres. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it gently 2 or 3 times, just to finish bringing it together. Shape the dough into a round disc about 3/4 inch thick and 5 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before proceeding.

To mix using a food processor: Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse 5 times to blend the ingredients.

Add the cold butter pieces and pulse 6 to 8 times, just until the butter is the size of large peas. In a separate bowl, whisk together the yolks, vanilla, and 1 teaspoon of water. Add this to the bowl of the processor, then process just until the dough begins to form small clumps-do not let it form a ball. Test the dough by squeezing a handful of clumps-they should hold together. If not, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough coheres. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it gently 2 or 3 times, just to finish bringing it together. Shape it into a round disc about 3/4 inch thick and 5 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before proceeding.

To mix by hand: Place the flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and blend well with a whisk. Add the cold butter pieces and toss until they are lightly coated with the flour. Use your fingertips, 2 knives, or a pastry blender to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. If at any time during this process the butter softens and becomes warm, place the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes before continuing. In a separate bowl, whisk together the yolks, vanilla, and 2 teaspoons of water. Add this to the dry ingredients and toss between your fingertips 20 to 30 times to evenly distribute the moisture. The dough will still look very crumbly, but if the mixture is squeezed in your hand, it should hold together. If not, add the remaining teaspoon of water and toss to blend. Turn the dough out of the bowl onto your work surface and knead it gently 5 or 6 times, just to finish bringing it together. Shape it into a round disc about 3/4 inch thick and 5 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before proceeding.

TO LINE THE TART PAN 
To roll out the dough: It is easiest to roll this dough when it is at cool room temperature. This means that if it has been refrigerated for longer than 30 minutes, let it sit on the counter for 10 to 15 minutes before rolling it out (if it is too cold, the dough will crack as you attempt to roll it).

Place the disc of dough between two 12 inch pieces of plastic wrap. Roll the dough into an 11-inch round as shown, rotating it clockwise slightly after each roll to create an even round. Remember to roll from the center outward and to lift the rolling pin at the edge rather than smashing the edge down. As you roll, the plastic wrap will wrinkle and resist. When this happens, peel it off and replace it smoothly, then flip the dough over and repeat with the plastic on the other side before you continue rolling. You may need to do this several times during the rolling process. (Experienced pastry makers may wish to roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface, turning the dough as you roll and dusting the work surface and dough with extra flour as needed to keep it from sticking. Before transferring the dough to the tart pan, brush any excess flour from the surface, then flip it over and brush the flour from the bottom as well. Transfer the dough to the tart pan by rolling it around your rolling pin, then unrolling it into the pan.)

Transfer the dough to the tart pan by removing the top piece of plastic wrap. Leave the bottom piece on to hold the dough together while you lift it and flip it over into the tart pan (remaining plastic side should be up), centering it as best you can as shown. Remove the top layer of plastic wrap and press the dough into the corners of the pan using your fingertips. Patch any tears by simply pressing the dough together, then build the edge of the tart slightly above the rim of the pan by reinforcing each flute. To do this, press the index finger of one hand against the dough inside the curve of each flute to push the dough upward while at the same time pressing the dough from the outside of each flute with the thumb and index finger of your other hand in a pinching position. The dough should rise about 1/4 inch above the rim of the pan all the way around. Place the tart pan, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 1 hour or in the freezer for 30 minutes.

TO BAKE THE TART SHELL
To prebake the tart shell: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Line the chilled tart shell with heavy-duty foil, pressing the foil firmly into the corners of the pan. Fill the pan with metal pie weights, dried beans, or rice. The center layer of weights may be thinner, but be sure to push the weights all the way up the sides of the pan to reduce shrinkage and to ensure the edges are straight.

To partially bake the shell: Bake for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges and center are set and no longer stick to the foil when you try to remove it. Remove the foil and weights and return the pan to the oven for another 8 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is a pale tan color. Place on a rack to cool completely before filling the shell.

To fully bake the shell: Bake for about 20 to 22 minutes, or until the edges and center are set and no longer stick to the foil when you try to remove it. Remove the foil and weights and return the pan to the oven for another 8 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown all over. Place on a rack to cool completely before filling the shell.&quot;;&quot;1231775556&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Siena Tart&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/desserts/siena-tart&quot;;&quot;Siena is a charming medieval city just south of Florence that is best known for its famous horse race, called the Palio, in which riders wearing the bright, traditional colors and insignia of each of the city's time-honored neighborhoods vie for first place in a thunderous free-for-all around the beautiful piazza. It is a place that takes tradition seriously, in food as well as horse races, which is evident in its dedication to panforte. Every store in the city seems to have its own "best" version of this honey-based cross between a fruitcake and a candy, with a chewy, dense, caramel-like texture packed with almonds and hazelnuts, spices, and candied citrus peels. While in Siena, I tasted many versions-all for research purposes, you understand-and my favorites were those that contained the cocoa, which tempers the sweetness and adds complexity to the flavor. I couldn't help thinking that panforte would be even better packed with those addictive dried sour cherries from Michigan that I adore. This tart is very reminiscent in flavor to a scuro panforte, although it is not the classic cake-like confection. Instead, a crisp tart shell is filled with almonds (both sliced and whole for a contrast of textures) and dried sour cherries coated with just enough honey, spices, and citrus zest to sweeten them. The tart is a gorgeous, rustic sight, the sensuous curves of the nuts and cherries a glistening medley of browns. I serve it during the winter months, when its spicy flavors and chewy crunchiness are most appreciated.

YIELD: serves 8 to 10 

EQUIPMENT AND ADVANCE PREPARATION: 
1 recipe Shortcrust Dough to fill a 9-or 9 1/2 inch fluted tart pan with removable bottom, partially baked and cooled 

FOR THE FILLING 
1 1/2 cups (4 1/2 ounces) sliced almonds 
3/4 cup (3 3/4 ounces) whole natural almonds
3/4 Cup (3 1/2 ounces) dried sour cherries 
4 tablespoons (3/4 ounce) powdered sugar 
2 teaspoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
1/8 teaspoon ground coriander 
Pinch of ground white pepper 
1/2 cup (6 ounces) honey, preferably orange blossom or wildflower 
1 tablespoon finely minced orange zest, about 1 large orange 
1 teaspoon finely minced lemon zest 

FOR SERVING 
Powdered sugar 
Honeyed Mascarpone

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven.

To make the filling, place the sliced almonds, whole almonds, and cherries in a medium mixing bowl. Sift the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and spices over them and stir with a rubber spatula until they are evenly coated. Place the honey, orange zest, and lemon zest in a small saucepan and cook over low heat just until the honey is hot to the touch and very liquid - do not let it boil. Remove from the heat and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, so that the honey is flavored with the citrus zests. Then pour the honey over the nuts and cherries, scraping every bit out of the pan with the rubber spatula. Stir until everything is evenly coated with the honey. At first, it will seem that there is not enough honey, but continue to stir gently (trying not to break the sliced almonds) and eventually the nuts will be thoroughly coated. Be sure to scrape up from the bottom of the bowl as you stir, as pockets of dry cocoa powder and spices tend to form there. 

Scrape the filling into the prebaked tart shell and use the spatula or your hands to pat it into an even layer. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a deep golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool completely. 

To unmold, when cool, center the tart pan on top of a large can (1 use a large can of tomatoes) so that it balances midair as the rim of the tart pan falls to the counter. Leave the bottom of the pan under the tart for support, or slide the tart onto a serving plate by running a large spatula between the crust and the pan, using it to guide the tart onto the plate. 

SERVING AND STORAGE NOTES: If desired, dust the surface of the tart with a bit of powdered sugar. Serve at room temperature with a spoonful of honeyed mascarpone. Because the filling’s rather sticky, I find it easiest to cut this tart with a thin, sharp knife that has been lightly coated with a flavorless vegetable oil. Store, covered loosely with foil, at room temperature for up to 5 days.&quot;;&quot;1231776503&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Obama & Spider-Man&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/obama-sold-out&quot;;&quot;Marvel comics has been doign a great job of creating marketing events over the past year or so - which is good because they haven't focused on creating great comic books. This week, on the cover of "The Amazing Spider-Man", is Barack Obama. For some reason, this is a really big deal. Apparently there's a mini-story in the book involving Spider-Man and Obama. I'm happy for the author, who I think has been one of the more under-rated comic book authors in the past few years. I'm doing him a service by not reading his comics anymore, because whenever I start reading them, they get canceled. Plus, I'm not that big of a Spider-Man fan.

Anyway, comic book stores have been sold out for over a week and it just got released today. There are all sorts of notices at comic book stores to pre-order and that you are limited to one copy per customer. Maybe someday I'll grumble when I see collector's editions of this issue going for thousands of dollars. But for now, I don't really care.

I keep digressing. This morning I went to my local comic book store. They had only been open an hour and they had already posted a sign on their front door that they were sold out of the Obama issue. And what's even more impressive, is that someone had <em>already</em> put graffiti on the sign. 

I'll let the photo speak for itself. 

New York cracks me up.

&quot;Westminster Dog Show 2009&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/dogs/westminster-dog-show-2009&quot;;&quot;A couple of weekends ago, Evan & Renee (Gogo & Oz's breeders) came to New York City for a visit. They had two of their dogs competing in the Westminster Dog Show. I was able to tag along for the Canaan Dog competition. 

For those of you that have only been exposed to dog shows via the movie "Best in Show", in some ways I think the movie's caricatures pale in comparison to real life. There were some real characters backstage with their dogs. And the movie did not accurately depict the look of sheer boredom that the dogs had on their face as they were being prepared for the ring. I felt most sorry for the poodles, who all had a look on their face of "Not this again". 

I took some photos backstage, then when the Canaan Dogs were ready to compete, I tried taking shots of the action in the ring. I learned a couple of things about dog shows. First of all, the dogs are only looked at for a minute or two, so if the dog doesn't feel like showing themselves off for a judge at that exact minute, you're done. Secondly, to see why the judges are picking certain dogs, you have to be right up close to them. There's no way you can tell from a TV camera. Yes, some of the winners that I saw definitely had "star quality" - but I don't think it's the sort of thing I would have noticed from TV. (Although, the one photo in my set that I thought was really beautiful was of the dog that ended up winning the Canaan Dog competition)

A few notes:

It was really dark in the auditorium for photography. I was nowhere near close enough for the flash to make any difference. I opted for a long shutter speed and waiting for the subjects to be still. That wasn't such a smart idea. No one wanted to sit still for me. Someday I'll be able to afford a lens with a nice big aperture so I can get away with more low-light shots, but not this year.

&quot;Chocolate Post-Mortem&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/food/chocolate-post-mortem&quot;;&quot;This was my third year making holiday-time chocolates for friends, family, and co-workers. This year Mom helped me hit a record of 1080 individual pieces of chocolate. Every year I learn a lot about the process and I'm convinced I'll remember it all the following year. And every year I start the process with the same set of questions and frustrations. So this year I'm writing down everything I learned over the process for notes to next year.<!--break-->

To start off, here are the finished chocolates: 

[flickr-photo:id=3441991412,size=m,align=c]

The flavors are:

<ul>

<li><strong>American</strong> - Peanut butter in milk chocolate
<li><strong>German</strong> - Cherry and almond cream in dark chocolate
<li><strong>Turkish</strong> - Pistachio and spices in dark chocolate
<li><strong>Brazil</strong> - Passion fruit & guava fondant in white chocolate
<li><strong>Colombian</strong> - Orange and coffee in white chocolate
<li><strong>English</strong> - Milk chocolate caramel in dark chocolate
<li><strong>Mexican</strong> - Cinnamon & pepper milk chocolate in dark chocolate
<li><strong>Indian</strong> - Masala chocolate in milk chocolate

</ul>

The good news is that all the flavors were great. I usually change the flavors around a bit every year, but think I've found my permanent list. I wouldn't mind finding another flavor for Asia, but I don't know who I would bump from the current list.

Now on to lessons learned: 

<ul>

<li>With my new chocolate temperer, I had to determine the temperatures myself. The milk chocolate was too runny and some of the batches were slightly out of temper by the end. It went into the molds a little too thin. Next year, my final temperature for milk chocolate should be a bit cooler than what the package recommended. And let it dry in the molds a bit more than last year.

<li>In contrast to the milk chocolate, the dark chocolate was very thick when it went into the molds. This led to the German chocolates being "the disaster batch". On the dark chocolate, keep the resting temperature of the chocolate a little on the high side and get it into the molds quickly. And when you dump the partially melted chocolate out of the molds, you have to really bang the dark chocolate out.

<li>For the German batch, the idea of chopping up sour cherries and putting them in the chocolates was a big headache and didn't work. In the future, put the cherries directly into the cream and pipe it in.

<li>The big enemy for molded chocolates is air bubbles. One option is to paint the inside of molds first, before pouring the chocolate in. That's very time-consuming. I was able to keep the air bubbles to a minimum if I keep the mold tilted while I pour the chocolate. And pour at the top of the mold so that the chocolate drips down into the crevices. Give everything a very vigorous shake to work bubbles to the top. Pour more chocolate if necessary. Then wipe it all clean with an offset spatula. That should take care of air bubbles. Don't be afraid to bang the mold of chocolates.

<li>For the fondants, use the recipes on my spreadsheet. Don't look for a different recipe. The passion fruit didn't set up at first and took a lot of work to come together.

<li>For fillings that are dependent on white chocolate, melt a bunch of white chocolate first, then add flavoring until you get the right consistency. Don't add melted chocolate to flavoring. It takes forever to know if you have the right consistency.

</ul>

That's all I can remember. Let's hope that this all makes sense in December when I do it again.&quot;;&quot;1239723016&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Family Trip to Hawaii&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/family-trip-hawaii&quot;;&quot;I hadn't been to Hawaii in about 10 years. The last time I was there, I was staying in an old coffee shack on the Rosenworld Compound. I have very fond memories of the trip. I did not have fond memories of the never-ending flights home and the resulting jet lag. So I hadn't particularly rushed to go back. 

My parents have been going for many years - never waiting more than two years to go there. And recently I believe they had been going every year. So it was no surprise that eventually they would want a family trip to Hawaii together. So David, myself, Sis, Lorenz, and my parents met in Kona on the Big Island for a week of Polynesian goodness. <!--break-->

On the way out there, David and I stayed a night in Honolulu. We couldn't find reasonable flights through American that got us there in one day. It was probably a good idea to have a night in Honolulu. We would have been zombies if we tried to do the flight in one swoop. The airport was swamped with security when we got to Honolulu. I asked David with as much sarcasm as I could muster "Is the President in town or something?" It turns out that he kinda was. Barack Obama was president elect and was on his way out of Hawaii as we were coming in. There went my plans of getting a photo of our President's abs on the beach to sell to tabloids.

For some reason, we got to the Honolulu airport very early the morning. It turns out I don't like the Honolulu airport. It was full or extremely obese Americans with their ultra-slutty teenage daughters and their mind-numbingly stupid teenage sons. They embodied the image of American terror that strikes the hearts of foreigners everywhere.

When we got to Kona, I was in a significantly better mood. David and I got ourselves to the time share and were quite surprised at how nice the digs were. Our unit felt palatial. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and equipment, though David didn't look any further than the coffee machine. 

I picked up Mom & Dad at the airport later that day. For dinner, we went up to the Rosenworld compound and picked up Sis and Lorenz. I hadn't been there since they built the new house. I don't even think they call it the new house anymore. It was beautiful. I decided that the next time I come to Hawaii, I'm doing it without family or David and I'm staying at the compound for some peace and quiet. They have every type of fruit on their plantation: macadamia nuts, pineapples, avocados, passion fruit, guava, lemons, grapefruit, papayas, and more. Andy had made a wonderful guava cake with guava mousse. I'm still dreaming about it.

Looking back on it, I can't remember the exact order of everything we did on the trip. David, Sis, Lorenz and I took a day to go to the volcano. It rained almost the entire day. I thought Lorenz would be more entranced with the idea of lava tubes and volcanos, but he was in his own world the whole time. We took him to the 15 minute movie they show about volcanos. Once he realized it was a documentary, he turned to Sis and said "This isn't a real movie." Apparently, he had just discovered the soul-crushing reality of documentaries. And when they showed images of volcanoes spewing and gurgling red molten lava, he just said "Yucky".

On the way home we went to a beach to visit giant turtles. And they were quite big. Lorenz started being a pill, then decided he didn't want to wear pants, and then decided he wanted to sit on the sand. David and Sis made him take a mini-shower before getting back in the car. I took a picture should I need to blackmail Lorenz at some future point. However, I have spared his dignity by not posting it online.

I can't remember what we need the next day, but I didn't take any photos. I think Sis, Dad, Benji and I went snorkeling. Which was nice but a little crowded. 

David charted a course for the next day. We were going to visit a small little village on the way up the mountain and then visit a coffee plantation. The village was mostly closed and kind of a bust. Then we couldn't find the coffee plantation. It turns out that GPS is not so accurate in Hawaii - as we would repeatedly learn throughout the trip. Just after we had given up on finding the coffee plantation, we decided to go back just ONE MORE TIME, and we found it. They had pigs and geese and cats, so Lorenz was in heaven. They had coffee, so David was in heaven. We bought several bags, and it really is the best coffee I've ever had.

After that we took a trip back down to the beach, with a few wrong turns along the way. We found a place  where there is some beach and then a little walk to visit Petraglyphs. On the way home, we stopped in downtown Kona for some shaved ice and a walk along the beach. Very beautiful.

The next day was a big event. We took a trip up and over the middle of the island on Saddle Road. The goal was to go to Hilo and see some of the big waterfalls. Benji had said that Hilo is his favorite city in Hawaii because it's like the old Hawaii used to be before it was discovered by all the tourists. It rains too much to ever be a popular tourist destination. We totally lucked out. It was sunny and clear the whole time we were there.

We saw many waterfalls. We even found the cheap, fast food place that Mom and Dad were looking for. There some story about it being owned by a relative of someone that they work with. I don't remember the whole story. The food was authentically Hawaiian.

Mom & Dad started showing signs of exhaustion near the end of this trip. For the last waterfall (which was the really big one) they stayed near the car. Since the Saddle Road trip was not a good ride for those that get car-sick, we took a trip around the north of the island to get home.

David and I went home the next morning. I didn't get as much time frolicking in the water at the beach as I was hoping, but that's how it goes. Next time, I'm sure...

&quot;Anti-Advice&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/self-improvement/anti-advice&quot;;&quot;Tell me if this sounds familiar. A close friend or relative is complaining about an obstacle that they have in life: problems at work, spousal frustrations, backstabbing friends, etc. You listen attentively and politely. You offer productive and easy-to-follow advice. You friend looks at you like you have overstepped some boundaries. They either tell you that your advice wouldn't work and launch into more complaining or they are downright offended that you offered unwelcome advice. And no one ever follows your advice. Ever.

Many years ago, I decided that most people aren't really asking for advice, they are asking for you to sit there in rapt attention while they bitch. You fare better as a friend by occasionally muttering "That sucks" or - even better - "So what are you going to do?"

I have found the answer to giving advice. I call it "Anti-Advice" and I've had a lot of success with it. It goes along the same principle of homeopathic medicine. You don't try to cure the problem, you intensify the symptoms so that the body naturally solves the problem.

Here's an example: Your single friend is complaining about having gained weight recently and claims that it's too hard to lose weight. Here are some responses:

<blockquote>
	Who wants to lose weight anyway? It's a lot of work with little reward. Let's go for ice cream.
	
	So what if you've been gaining a lot of weight recently. It's a great excuse to buy more clothes!

	You look great. Would Kevin James be as popular if he were thin? You're like the Kevin James of [insert person's town or neighborhood].
</blockquote>

The key to anti-advice is that you have to really go for it. You can't get caught being disingenuous. Your voice can't be dripping with sarcasm or it doesn't work. Put a smile on your face and confirm their deepest anxieties. 

I've found myself liberated from my don't-say-anything approach to complaint sessions. I now politely listen to the complaints and search for the one thing they don't want to hear. When it works well, the complainer is completely stymied. It also frees you from expecting some sort of positive outcome. In order to give anti-advice, you have to divest yourself of an expectation that things are going to change. In fact, you become an advocate of things never changing. 

Here are some more examples:

Your boss at work is unable to make decisions and commit to a direction. You have to constantly remind your boss that the wrong decision could have gargantuan ramifications.

A friend finds themselves sexually attracted to their roommates new boyfriend/girlfriend. How about they try to orchestrate a three-way with the roommate and love interest?

A friend is procrastinating and obsessing about how much work they have to get done. Tell them to blow off work and go to the movies. If they refuse but continue to procrastinate, start reading favorable reviews of movies currently playing.

Most of the time, people react so strongly to anti-advice that the subject is dropped. They may actually take steps to fix the problem. Or they realize that you are not mentally balanced enough to be a source of any advice.

One point of warning: anti-advice doesn't work on children or pets. The target person has to have some sort of super-ego in place for this to work. 

I probably wouldn't recommend trying it on the criminally insane either - but who am I to try to tell people what to do? After all, the population could stand to be thinned out a bit.&quot;;&quot;1239983080&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Keith's First Acupuncture&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/health/keiths-first-acupuncture&quot;;&quot;Today was my first acupuncture session. I had pulled my back out about a week and a half ago. I told myself in Africa that it was time to try acupuncture, but I hadn’t gotten around to it. So with my back out, I decided it was time to make an appointment and try it.

I had heard various stories of people going to acupuncture and the needles having a visceral and sudden effect on their body. Sometimes it was described as a jolt of electricity, sometimes it was described as a sudden withdraw of tension. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect.

I got a referral from my friend, Kevin, to see Jackie at Blue Lotus Healing. I tried finding a website for them to put on this post, but I can’t find one. Maybe someday I can put a few pages together for them - though I don’t think they really need the business.

Jackie had told me to set aside 2 hours for the first appointment. I think we used the whole time, but I was so zonked out at the end that I forgot to look at the time. When I got into the room, I got down to my underwear and got on the table. Jackie is very chatty and easy to talk with - which was good because I was a little nervous. She started by taking my pulse and checking for energy flow. She immediately zeroed into a stiff spot in my abdomen. She told me I had digestive issues (true), and that I was probably low on energy (also true - the past couple of years, despite diet and exercise, I have not had one of those “limitless energy” days that I used to have). So she put in a few needles. They went all over - abdomen, ankles, arms, hands, etc. I quickly lost track of where they were. It almost felt like I had little thread coming out of me, like a marionette’s strings, and someone was gently pulling on them. She put one into my arm that when in with a bit of a “woo” sensation. The first couple of minutes I thought I was going to mention that it hurt, but soon I had no real sensation of it at all.

I have to admit, I was kind of surprised that I didn’t really feel that much. I gently blissed out for a while. She came back in, took out the needles, and I got a brief back massage. I flipped over onto my stomach and she put needles in my back. I felt these needles even less than the ones on my front. When I was done, she asked me to do a simple stretch (a child’s pose - for you yoga folk), get dressed and meet her outside.

When I got off the table, I was really hoping that there wasn’t going to be any back pain whatsoever. But it was still there. There was less of it, but it was still there.

When I got outside, I was visibly out of it. People that had seen me before I went in started commenting about me as if I wasn’t in the room - “Look, his eyes are so open now! What a difference!” Jackie said that I was “acu-stoned”. For a while, I didn’t realize what they were talking about. But as I walked outside, I discovered I couldn’t make simple decisions. My perception of time was way off. I felt like I was high. 

I went out to lunch with Jeff, feeling giddy the whole time. I found myself blatantly smiling at people, so much so that I would start making jokes with strangers. People were laughing with me. It was kinda crazy.
I got home and took things relatively easily. And I noticed as the afternoon went on, my back got better and better. I felt like I had all-of-a-sudden put my body on the fast track to healing. I’m still kind of marveling at the difference between this morning and now.

I watched the season finale of Lost and my emotions - while not out of control - were so clear and in the foreground. I choked up three times (at least) while watching Lost.

At the beginning of the session, Jackie had mentioned that about 3-4 visits would get my back to return to normal. At the end of the session, she said it would probably be only one more visit. But at this point, I don’t know why I wouldn’t want to go as much as possible.&quot;;&quot;1242338330&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;A Month in Africa&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/africa/month-africa&quot;;&quot;Did David and I really go to Africa? Were we really gone for 3.5 weeks? It all feels like an ethereal dream at this point. 

This first time that I remember seriously thinking about what Africa may be like was at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. I was watching "Road to Mecca" by Athol Fugard. Two women were talking about South Africa and the landscape that one woman had traveled to visit the other. She referred to the land as "God's Country". I had heard that phrase many times before and I had always interprested it as meaning "a land so beautiful that it was loved by God." In the play, they clarify what they mean by that phrase - a land that was untouched by humanity and incapable of being affected by humanity. As I'm writing about my impressions about a play that I saw over 20 years ago I realize that I could be completely mangling the play. I hope you understand my point anyway.

My other serious consideration of Africa was from reading "The Poisonwood Bible". Unfortunately, I didn't like the book (can't remember why anymore). But it did leave me with an impression that Africa lumbers on with its own rules. It doen't give you, a westerner or an individual, a second thought. I vividly remember the images of the missionaries trying to build American crops in the Congo. When they finally figure out how to work against the floods and the ants and grow crops, the African bees show no interesting in pollinating the strange new plants. 

All of this is true. And if you don't really understand what I'm talking about with my vague writing, I urge you to go to Africa. Follow an elephant on foot. Track a lion. Hang out with the Maasai. You'll see what I'm talking about.

&quot;One Day in Kenya&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/africa/one-day-kenya&quot;;&quot;We had a few very circuitous flights in Africa (to say the least). One of them was getting to Tanzania. We had to find flights that were cheap, get us to Arusha, and would get us miles. So to get us to Arusha, we flew overnight to London Heathrow, spent a few hours, then took a flight to Nairobi, Kenya. We spent two nights in Kenya - though we arrived so late and left so early in the morning that it felt like we were barely there. Also, we were so jet-lagged that we didn't really have much functional time.

Still, we got a realtively early start in the morning and got a tour guide to drive us around. He drove us to the Nairobi National Museum, which was a great introduction. Inside, a licensed guide took us around. One of the highlights was a very well-preserved woolly mammoth fossil.

Our next stop was to a giraffe sancutary where you can get close enough to the giraffes to feed them. It turns out, that a couple of the giraffes are shameless beggars and will do anything for food. David got a fair amount of giraffe slobber on him while he was posing for a photo.

While we were having coffee, we talked with a Canadian that had just finished going on safari. She couldn't stop saying wonderful things about her trip. David and I were still wondering exactly what the trip was going to be like. It's not something you can really imagine until you've done it. And I suppose that each trip varies greatly depending on specifically where you go and with whom.

On the way back to the hotel, we got stuck in the famous Nairobi traffic. We passed by some shanty towns (which are called townships in Africa). It's hard to capture how sprawlingly large the townships can be with a photo. We started getting a taste of the crazy culture clashes in Africa. We were driving on a major highway and right along the side, people were herding cattle. And just past that, there were people in business suits walking to work. When we were completely stopped in traffic, there men selling all sorts of items: fans, stickers of animals, medical supplies, etc.

On the way out of Kenya I was expecting a real headache at the airport. It was just the opposite. Everyone was as nice as could be and really quite efficient on getting us ot the gate. The only drawback is that we had quite a wait for our flight because we got there so much ahead of schedule.

We flew from Kenya and on to Tanziania to start the safari.

&quot;First Night in Arusha&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/africa/first-night-arusha&quot;;&quot;After Kenya, we headed to Tanzania for one night in Arusha. The flight to Tanzania was fairly uneventful. On the flight, there was a small contingency of young frat-style guys with a ton of outdoor gear. They were clearly off to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro. David and I christened them “Kilimanjarheads”. <!--break--:>

At the airport, we were met by Urassa - one of the drivers for our trip. We later learned that his real name is “Goodluck Urassa”. We figured that he went by the name of Urassa because he was tired of all the Americans being confused or making jokes about a name of Goodluck.

We drove about 45 minutes to Arusha. It was dark, so there was not much to see. We would periodically pass a small collection of houses with lights - usually with a bar or restaurant where the locals were congregated. We didn’t see many cars on the road, but we saw lots of people walking or riding bicycles. Since there were no street lights and very few houses, it was pitch black out. I suppose people had to hug the road to make sure they didn’t get lost. I kept thinking that we were so far away from anything, that anyone walking would take hours to get anywhere.

We arrived at our destination, the Serena Mountain Village Lodge. Upon stepping onto the property, there was someone greeting us with warm, wet towels. That seemed nice at the time - later I would realize just how nice it is to be greeted with a wet towel while traveling through East Africa.

We checked into our bungalow and then headed to dinner. We made all sorts of conjectures about who in the dining area was going to be on our safari. There was a very poorly behaved Russian family that had been on the flight with us - arguing with every service person they ran into. They were thankfully not on our safari. I don’t remember seeing anyone in the dining room that night that was on our safari.

After breakfast, we met in front of the lodge as a group. We had the typical introductions and stilted conversations with people you don’t know but will soon be spending every waking moment together. We met our group leader: Sebastian Chuwa. Everyone met the driver that we had last night: Urassa. And we met our third driver: Mustafa Mollel.

Everyone made one final trip to their bungalows, and we were off on safari. Our first day was going to be spent driving through Lake Manyara

&quot;Last Trip to Ithaca&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/family/last-trip-to-ithaca&quot;;&quot;In May of 2009, Mom and Dad flew to New Jersey, spent a night with me, and then we all drove up to Ithaca for a family weekend. It was billed as a “Pre-Mother’s Day” event - since the timing did not work out for Mom and Dad to visit on actual Mother’s Day. I was only there for a couple of days before driving home. Mom and Dad stayed for longer and flew back from Ithaca.

We had no hard and fast plans for what to do while we were there. Sis and had come up with plenty of options, but we kept it pretty open, since you never know what you’re going to be in the mood for.

Our big trip was driving to Watkins Glen, which is a town at the base of the largest of the Finger Lakes. There is a beautiful gorge there. Unfortunately, we were still on the heels of winter, so some of the paths were closed. Still, we were able to tour much of the gorge and take some nice family shots.

This trip marked a turning point in my relationship with Lorenz. Although he was typically totally nonplussed to see me, we got along great. Sis had given me the suggestion that I buy a Star Wars sticker book, since he talks about watching Star Wars with Uncle Keith. (It turns out he watched it with Uncle David, but I’m happy to take the credit.) When I had gone to Barnes & Noble to get sticker books, I had no idea there were so many. I got a little too excited for an adult when I saw that they had Fantastic Four sticker books. I decided to stay with the original plan and get Star Wars (though I also threw in a bugs sticker book). 

The book was a big hit and we played with the stickers over dinner. When food arrived, Sis told him to put the stickers away and Lorenz said no. I told him we would do two more stickers and then it was time to eat. It worked like a charm. No fuss at all when it was time to put the book away.

When we were at the gorge, he found a large stick and was using it like a gun, imaginarily shooting things. Sis hates any talk of guns and was trying to squelch such behavior. Since I needed to reinforce my status as “Bad Uncle” I encouraged Lorenz to shoot everything - “There’s Mommy! Shoot Mommy!” Mark put a positive spin on it saying that Lorenz sometimes says that the gun shoots a cleaning spray. So we then switched to saying “Lorenz! That’s dirty!” and he would shoot it clean. 

I know. Go figure.

We tried to get a shot of him shooting a big sign in the gorge that said “Lover’s Lane”, but the chain link fence ruined the shot. Bummer.

After the gorge we went for lunch. Mom and I walked Lorenz along the water, which he enjoyed. And then we all went for ice cream. It was a beautiful spring day and a very “upstate NY” time.

The next day was fairly uneventful. We went to the mall for reasons I can no longer remember. Then we went to the Farmer’s Market. It was a pale comparison to the last time I had been there - which was in the fall. A lot of the booths were empty since there were no harvests yet. I was hoping to take a homemade pie home, but I left empty handed.

Nice weekend. I’m sad to think that it’s probably my last trip to Ithaca since Sis is leaving in a month.

&quot;Our First CSA Haul&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/food/our-first-csa-haul&quot;;&quot;This year, David and I signed up for a CSA - which stands for "Community Supported Agriculture". It's a way for those of us living in New York City to get a weekly supply of organic and locally grown veggies every week. The share is roughly $450 and lasts for 24 weeks. We also signed up for a fruit share, which starts later in the year.

I really had no idea what to expect, except what I heard from a friend that had participated in a CSA last year. We signed up with a CSA for the West Village. Their pickup locations is less than a block away. Their farm is <a href="http://www.stoneledgefarmny.org/" target="_blank">Stone Ledge Farm"</a> and they are an organic farm.

This week was almost all leafy green vegetables - which is what I was hoping for. I don't recognize some of the items. I'm assuming that I can eat most - if not all - of the foods raw. Here's the whole list:

<ul>
<li>RHUBARB-1 bunch-very tart perennial that is only available for a short time in the spring.
<li>RED LEAF LETTUCE (Red Tide)-1 head
<li>MIZUNA-1 bunch (Green with serrated leaves. Good in salads or lightly cooked)
<li>ARUGULA-1 bunch
<li>BOK CHOI-1 head (white, crunchy stems, dark green leaves)
<li>CHINESE CABBAGE (Rubicon)-2 heads (described in the seed catalog as “sweet, tangy, juicy and delicious”) This makes a great fresh slaw or used in stir fry.
<li>RADISHES-1 bunch
<li>SAGE with Flowers-1 bunch. The flowers are beautiful on the sage which grows as a perennial. Strip the leaves and use with any poultry dish. Enjoy the flowers as a bonus.
</ul>

As my friend said, it's sort of like an episode of Iron Chef - you never know what you're getting from week to week. The fun of it is coming up with something once you know the ingredients.

&quot;To Milan and the Lake Region&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/italy/milan-and-lake-region&quot;;&quot;Every time we go to Italy, I say that we don't go to Italy enough. Why does it only happen once every few years? We had dinner with one of David's colleagues in Milan that tells us she goes to Rome twice a year. Granted, she's a hell of a lot closer, but still...we should be going ot Italy more. I haven't been to Rome in over 10 years! What's wrong with me?
<!--break-->
So even though it was a short trip (only 4 nights), and David would be at a conference a lot of the time, how could I pass up a trip to Milan with David?&quot;;&quot;1244933024&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;I've Landed...What's Happening?&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/italy/ive-landedwhats-happening&quot;;&quot;I flew to Milan by myself. David was coming in from England. So even though I got there ahead of time, David had not taken red-eye flight to get to Milan and he had already adjusted to the time change. I got ot the hotel first and took a nap for a few hours. There is nothing like that first nap when you arrive in Europe from an overnight flight.

Eventually, he prompted me to get up. The whole thing was helped by the fact that he had got some pastries to help me ease into consciousness. After I pulled myself together, we went to the Piazza del Duomo to see the center of Milan. 

We started our tour by buying tickets to get into a broom closet of an elevator to the base of the roof. The Duomo di Milano is one of the few cathedrals that you can climb all over. Well, that's an exaggeration. You can walk all over the roof. And by the time you get to the top, you're pretty high up. There are non-stop carvings along the way. Every where you turn there's a gargoyle or statue - completely unique amongst the others. The top of the Duomo has all sorts of saints placed high on top and facing out towards the city. It is intensely serene to look at the saints as they monitor the encroaching modernity of high-fashion Milan. 

David and I made it all the way to the top, but we felt raindrops, so took the stairs down and went inside the cathedral. The fun part abotu visiting cathedrals in Italy is that they are still quite well attended. We saw plenty of people praying or waiting to make confession.

One of the highlights in the cathedral is a statue of Saint Bartholomew, who was flayed alive. The statue has him wearing his skin like a shawl or a toga - and he is nothing but muscle and bone. It's very surreal. There were plenty of saints around the cathedral that had been stabbed with arrows or eviscerated and left for dead.

After the cathedral, we walked a bit around the piazza so I could get something to eat. However, we had missed lunch hour and barely anyone was serving anymore. So we went back to the hotel and I caught a nap before dinner.

And dinner that night was at a very well-known restaurant called Bice. It's apparently well attended by high fashion designers. We didn't see any that night. The meal was excellent and we were joined by two colleagues from Israel. We had the full experience, including Santo Vino with Biscotti for an aperitif. 

When we got back to the hotel, I slept for something like 12 hours. I was woken by David getting ready. I said "I'll join you for breakfast and then shower when you head off ot the conference." He replied "I've already had breakfast. You slept through all of it."

Oh. Oops.

&quot;West Village CSA - Week 2&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/food/west-village-csa-week-2&quot;;&quot;I figure I'll get bored of posting the weekly CSA haul, but when I was looking for a CSA, I couldn't find any information about what was in the CSA from week to week. So maybe these posts will help someone else. Also, so far I've had something every week that I have never seen before in my life. So there's some food education going on here as well.

Here's the note from the CSA about this week's produce:

<blockquote>

Among the top favorite vegetables that members look forward to receiving each year are Garlic Scapes. They are the long, curly tailed seed head that emerges from the garlic plant early in the season.

The scape will develop seed if left but the seeds are small and take years of planting and re-planting to deliver any sizable garlic bulbs. The preferred method of propagating garlic is each year to save the best bulbs which are broken apart into individual cloves and planted in October. Each clove will yield a garlic bulb the next July. The scapes are removed when they start to curl and the energy that would go into producing seed goes to the garlic bulb. 

The scapes have a delicious garlic flavor. Garlic scape pesto is a member favorite. Remove the very end of the scape and the rest of the scape can be used. Look to some of the CSA websites that are listed on the farm website under a previous blog for recipe ideas. There are also more photos of the garlic plants in the Photos section of the farm website. 

Enjoy the vegetables-Deborah for everyone at Stoneledge Farm
 
Garlic Scapes-6
Red Leaf Lettuce-1 head
Buttercrunch Green Leaf Lettuce-1 head
Bok Choi-2 heads
Mizuna-1 bunch
Summer Spinach-1 bunch-this spinach is a little more resilient than the spinach you may be familiar with. Most varieties of spinach will bolt or send out a seed head early in the season. Summer Spinach will last right into the summer. It has a larger leaf, spinach flavor. 
Mustard Greens-1 bunch 
Lemon Balm-1 bunch-lemony mint flavor. Good in tea. 

</blockquote>

I'm most excited about the Buttercrunch Green Leaf Lettuce which looked extra creamy delicious.

I usually munch a bit on everything as I put it in the fridge. The garlic scape packs quite a bunch.&quot;;&quot;1245188018&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Mantova & Cremona&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/italy/mantova-cremona&quot;;&quot;On our second day, I was a bit more coherent when I woke up. I still didn't have it together to have breakfast with David. He went off to the conference for a bit and I tried to find the Etro store. It was a total bust. The main store was completely intimidating: bizarro fashions in the window with enormous prices. I didn't even bother going in. Then I tried to find their outlet store. It was a very frustrating experience. I <em>think</em> I found it, but I didn't bother ringing the buzzer to go in because I found no evidence of it being an actual store. Oh well. I didn't need to spend any money on clothes that I would rarely wear.

David came back to the hotel just before noon. We went to the nearby airport and rented a car to explore the lakes around Milan. David drove, which was fine by me. We got a GPS. I don't know how we could have done it without the GPS - some of the roads that we ended up in were tiny. 

Our first stop was Mantova. You may have heard of the anglicized name of Mantua. God only knows how the English mangled that one. I guess it's not as bad as turning Deutscheland into Germany. Anyway, Mantova is a small village built around three lakes. It's the town that Romeo fled to when he was banished. It's the setting of Verdi's Rigoletto. And it's a beautiful little tourism stop. The palazzos are lined with cafes and gelaterias. There was a rock band that performed in front of the clock tower.

There are a few churches to visit. Once of which is built over the blood of Christ. According to the tradition the earth and blood was brought to Mantua by the Roman centurion Longinus, who had scooped up the bloody earth from Christ's crucifixion.

But the mega-highlight is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Ducale_di_Mantova" target="_blank">Palazzo Ducale</a>. The palace is enormous. After about an hour of wandering through rooms, David and I wondered if we were still in Mantova. With the exception of the gardens, I preferred it to the palace at Versailles. 

I think we spend around 4-5 hours in Mantova. I found a spot for us to stop for dinner on the way home. So we set off on the back roads to Cremona. Once again, it's a beautiful little medieval village built along the water. This one was on the shores of the river Po. On the drive out of town, we saw a carnival built along the river. The dinner was exquisite. And it was one of those places where they kept giving us things we didn't ask for: a complimentary martini as we sat down, a complimentary appetizer to whet the palate, etc. I was almost full by the time the meal actually started. And it was here that my love of tortellini di zucca (pumpkin tortellini) was solidified. I'm still dreaming about that meal.

After dinner, we took wandered through the palazzo, which was full of people drinking, eating, and enjoying the night air. I took a few pictures of David which he will not allow me to post because they clearly show that he has been travelling all day.

The ride how was uneventful - considering that we were only an hour from Milan.

&quot;Bellinzona&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/italy/bellinzona&quot;;&quot;I've tagged this entry with "Italy" even though Bellinzona is in Switzerland. However, you would really never be able to tell that you left Italy in this part of Switzerland. 

David and I got an early start and hit the road to a town called Bellinzona. The ride there was pretty great, too. We drove past Lake Como and all sorts of other lakes. I could see that if you lived in northern Italy, it would be quite nice to have a summer condo on the lake. 

Bellinzona is famous for its three castles (Castelgrande, Montebello, Sasso Corbaro) that have been a UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2000. We had some initial trouble finding the castle - which seems kind of laughable in hind site. It's right in the center of town built on a hill. It is completely unmissable. In the end, we did the smart thing and just parked near the center of town and started walking. We got a heart pumping climb up the rampart walls to Castelgrande. 

The castle seemed rather modest at first, but there was plenty to explore. The views of the hills around Bellinzona were magnificent. And the more we walked around the castle, the more the magic started to work on us. You could wander all over the rampart walls which were covered in grass. They had taken the hills of the castle to grow grape vines. The castle has two towers: the white tower and the black tower. You can climb up each of them as long as you don't mind twisting stairs. We went to the museum but there was really nothing to see - especially since most of the items in the museum did not have English translations. There was an interesting painting of a man changing into a wolf - of which I took a picture.

After exploring the castle, David and I went back to the center of town for something to eat. As usual, we were too late for the lunch crowd and we had a hard itme finding anyone to serve us. About the time I had settled upon the idea of a gelato lunch, we found a Turkish take-out place and got döner kebab.

Our next stop was Orta, but we decided to take the long, scenic path around the edge of Lake Maggiore.

[flickr-photoset:id=72157619566577331]
&quot;;&quot;1245252847&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Orta&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/italy/orta&quot;;&quot;After taking a leisurely stroll down the west side of Lake Maggiore, we were ready to get out of the car. The afternoon rain had passed. We arrived at Orta San Giulio, managed to find parking, and trekked down the hill.

There are no cars allowed in the heart of town. Or more precisely, the town could not fit any cars. It's a labyrinth of tiny little cobbled streets. There's one main drag that most people use to meander through town. 

First things first, we stopped for a cappucinos. Ah...

Then after walking through town, we stopped at the main docks. There are boats that take people to San Giulio, an island just off the coast that is right out of a fairy tale. Here's a bit about San Giulio:

<blockquote>According to the legend, the Island of St. Giulio was dominated by a big serpent that destroyed everything. But when St. Giulio, that had the power to command over the waves, the storms, the wild animals and the human beings, arrived near the lake , waving his hand he chased away the dangerous menacing animal.

He reached the Island journeying over the water on his cloak guided by his staff. The big reptile disappeared and St. Giulio, tired and near to his death, thought that the island was the right place to build his hundredth and last church dedicated to the Holy Apostles. The Island of San Giulio is today a place of great mysticism.</blockquote>

At first, David didn't want to make the trek because it looked like there was a huge line for a boat. It turns out that getting a boat did not take long, but it was total chaos. There was a dispatcher that was shouting at all the boat captains and pointing various tourists to each of the boats. 

As part of the trip to the island, they take you all the way around the island. You get to see just how beautiful and bizarre the island is. There is only one road and it goes all the way around. If you go in one direction, it's called "The Street of Meditation" and has little signs giving you motivational phrases in 4 languages. If you walk the road in the other direction, it's called "The Street of Silence" and the same signs have writing on the back to encourage an appreciation of silence. Unfortunately, there were a lot of tourists and no one was much into the concept of silence.

After lots of strolling, we went back ot Orta San Giulio, checked out the local church, and then headed back to the car.

It was Sunday, so finding a place that was open for dinner was quite a challenge. We dropped the rental car off at the airport and got a very exuberant cab driver that took us to a couple of places, but they were all closed. We found a place near the hotel to eat.

&quot;Last Day in Milan&quot;;&quot;personal/travel/italy/last-day-milan&quot;;&quot;Well, it was the last day in Milan. Part of this trip was an effort to escape the madness of the renovation, and in that sense, the trip was a total winner. I feel like I've "done" Milan, though I would never pass up any chance to visit Italy again. But I feel like there was a lot of the surrounding area that I would love to come back and explore: Lake Como and Verona are two biggies. I could imagine spending at least a week, casually bopping from one small town to the next.

On my last day, I visited Castello Sforzesco. The castle is impressive, though there's not a lot to see. David joined me in the afternoon. I took him to the castle and then we went shopping.

Shopping! Finally!

It is stunning to wander around Milan and look at the fashions. However, I live in New York City. There isn't that much that you can get in Milan that you can't find in NYC. And with the exchange rate, you certainly aren't getting any bargains. And finally, I didn't really connect with anything. There were some things in the Etro store that I liked (I finally made it in), but the stuff that I liked was marked "slim fit" and I didn't even want to bother with the disappointment of how far away from "slim" I am. Widt-wise, the salesman was on par with a street lamp. So I decided to forgo a Milan purchase. However, I did enjoy talking David into getting something nice at the Zegna store.

That evening, we went to dinner with a colleague of David's from Amsterdam. We had a wonderful meal at the highest recommended restaurant in Milan (by the guide book): Trattorio Milanese. It was excellent. The whole meal tasted like it was made by the Italian grandmother I never had. Perhaps it was also the quality of the company.

It turns out that I picked the same restaurant that our friend's wife's department picked, so we got to meet some others from Amsterdam. We got an invitation to visit which I certainly hope will become something more than an idle nicety.

Ah...Milan, I will miss you.

And FYI - not only was it a good break from the renovation, since I've been back, it's been much easier to deal with the renovation, so I think we can say that Milan has <strong>cured</strong> me.

&quot;Homemade Ranch Dressing&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/salads/homemade-ranch-dressing&quot;;&quot;Since we joined our CSA, it's been clear that we're going to be eating a lot of salads. The majority of the produce so far has been leafy green vegetables - and in a large variety. So if I was going to be eating a lot of salads, I needed to come up with at least one salad dressing I really loved.

I hate most every salad dressing I've ever bought. Our default salad dressing is a balsamic vinaigrette. It's really more David's thing than mine. I have more fun with it when I get a fun vinegar - like passion fruit vinegar. What I really wanted was to master creamy salad dressings.

I looked for a ranch dressing recipe on the web. A lot of them recommended using MSG to add robustness. MSG?! Doesn't it defeat the purpose of a homemade salad dressing to be throwing in chemicals? 

Then I found a recipe posted on chowhound.com for a simple ranch dressing. I tried it and it was excellent. I added in a few touches from some of the other research that I did. I must say, this is one of the best dressings I've ever had. It's one of my staples now and it generally gets unsolicited compliments from guests.

Without further ado, here it is (and I sometimes halve the recipe if I'm just making it for me for the next couple of days):

1 cup mayo
1/2 cup kefir yogurt
1 or 2 cloves crushed garlic
1/2 tsp salt
2 TBsp parsley, chopped
2 TBsp chives
2 green onions, thinly sliced
1 tsp white vinegar (you could use rice wine or white wine vinegar)
freshly ground pepper
salt to taste
a dash of Worcester (totally optional)

It keeps for several days in the fridge. 

One commenter on chowhound commented that a real ranch recipe uses dill, to which the poster commented "So add dill." And it's true. You could add whatever herbs you had on hand to customize the recipe. &quot;;&quot;1245400913&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Sugar Snap Pea Salad&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/salads/sugar-snap-pea-salad&quot;;&quot;Our CSA has resulted in me having to learn a bunch of new recipes. Last week, we got 2 pounds of sugar snap peas. I've never really used sugar snap peas, so I did a web search and found the following recipe. It makes a great salad and is almost entirely raw - which is always a benefit. And I munch on the sugar snap peas as I make the salad. They are surprisingly munchable.<!--break-->

<ul>
<li>3/4 cup sliced radishes
<li>4 ounces sugar snap peas, sliced (about 1 1/4 cups)
<li>4 ounces ricotta salata, crumbled (about 1 cup)
<li>1/2 bunch mint leaves, torn (about 1/3 cup)
<li>1 clove garlic, minced
<li>Pinch kosher salt, more to taste
<li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
<li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
<li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
<li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste.
</ul>

In a large bowl, toss together the radishes, peas, ricotta and mint.

Using a knife or a mortar and pestle, make a paste of the garlic and salt. Place in a small bowl and add the lemon juice and balsamic vinegar and stir well to combine. Drizzle in the olive oil, stirring constantly, and add pepper to taste.

Pour dressing over salad and toss well to combine. Taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary.

This story is from The New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/dining/171arex.html?_r=1&quot;;&quot;1247061563&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Blue Jays Outside My Window&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nyc/blue-jays-outside-my-window&quot;;&quot;I had a treat today. Outside my office window, I was visited by two blue jays. I had been seeing them around the neighborhood recently, but these two hung out for quite a while just a foot outside my window. They didn't even seem bothered by my movement to get a camera and take photos.
<!--break-->
I assume that one is male and the other is female. The male is the one with a more pronounced crest. The female seemed to be nesting. She seemed fluffed up and didn't want to move. The male was flitting all over from branch to branch. I couldn't figure out if he was courting her or protecting her.

I'm not usually so easily swayed, but I have to admit that there was some magical qualities about their visit. We don't get much wildlife here in NYC and I rarely see birds other than pigeons. And the fact that they seemed so comfortable outside my window, contributed to the serendipitous qualities of their visit. Let's hope that it's an omen of good things to come.

&quot;Bye Bye Dairy&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nutrition/bye-bye-dairy&quot;;&quot;When I was in Beijing, I had almost no dairy. There was some milk available for coffee at the hotel, but after that there was nothing. Nothing with cheese on any menu I ever found. No cream sauces. I doubt they used butter to cook with. I think that's why real Chinese food has the wrap that you are hungry a half hour after you eat - because there isn't that dairy to give you an inflated sense of feeling weighed down.
<!--break-->
And I did experience the "hungry half hour later" thing. After a meal, there was usually a brief period of hunger followed by several hours of feeling very sated. And the nice thing was, I never got tired after I ate. I'm used to crashing after meals in the U.S. But in Beijing, we would eat and I would be ready to start off on my next round of adventures. 

The other big shift is that when I got home, everyone commented that my skin looked so much better. If I felt my skin, then yes, it felt softer and smoother - but mildly so. I never would have guessed that it would have been that noticeable, but it was Rodrigo's first comment when he saw me. I attributed it to the dairy after reading an article about Woody Harrelson's skin and dairy issues: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/23/woody-harrelsons-vegan-ac_n_295765.html

The odd thing about having had next to no dairy for a week is that I realized I didn't miss it. If the trade-off is that I have more energy, my skin is healthier, and I generally feel lighter and happier, well that seems like a no-brainer to me. So I've decided to minimize dairy as much as possible. I'm not going to say "never again", because that usually just means I can't stick with it. And it turns out it's not as difficult as I originally thought. 

My first fallen moment came when we had someone over for wine and cheese. I got a fancy cheese to share. I couldn't resist a farmhouse cheddar. And once I had a little bit, I went back a few more times. The next morning I woke up with a headache and a head full of phlegm. 

I always find it so odd that when I give up some unhealthy eating habits and then go back to them, what a gargantuan crash I have. Was it always this bad when I had dairy and I just never noticed? Or was body used to all the extra phlegm and coped with it better?

So dairy has been greatly reduced in my life with an end goal of getting rid of it entirely. After only a few days, I have so much more energy. Chronic sinus discomfort or pain? Gone. 

If you have dairy now, just try going one week with as little dairy as you can muster. I think you'll be surprised that you won't miss it and the benefits are tremendous.&quot;;&quot;1256306423&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;

&quot;A Hammerlock Swing Dance Move with Neat-o Exit&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/swing/some-hammerlock-swing-dance-moves&quot;;&quot;I've been meaning to write down some of the new dance moves I learn in private class so that I don't forget them. And what better place than a blog for others that might be curious?

The past couple of private lessons have been dedicated to hammerlock positions. While they look incredibly twisty and complicated, it turns out that they're really easy.

The first one I learned starts with a tuck-turn on the leader's right side. At the end of the tuck, you give the partner a good spin, hold onto the hands, and put them into a hammerlock. It helps if you use your right hand on your partner's hip to guide them. Instead of rock-stepping backward, rock-step forward. Then spin them back around into a cuddle position. 

From there, Nathan taught me a fun move to get out of it. It's an 8 count move to make it easier on the follower. You rock-step backward and go forward for the first triple. Give the follower a little notice with your arms that something is about to happen. Then on the step-step, create a tunnel with your right arm (which is behind your partner) and lean at the hips and don't go back with the follower. They will get the signal and shoot behind you. At this point, you should still be hold hands and they will be totally criss-crossed. Go with it. Lead a tuck turn and don't let go of the hands. At the end of the tuck turn, you will be magically correct.

Damn. Now I can't remember the other hammer-lock move that Nathan taught me. Well, stay tuned and I'll write it down from tonight's refresher course.&quot;;&quot;1258672251&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Big and Fearless&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/learning/big-and-fearless&quot;;&quot;Last year, my friend Sara asked me about my resolutions that I had for 2009. For some reason, I took it very seriously and wrote a lengthy post about my resolutions. I accomplished most of them to some degree. I'm not going to worry about the ones that I apparently wasn't as resolute on as I could have been. But we both enjoyed the process so she wrote me this year for my 2010 resolutions. And here they are...
<!--break-->
* The first one is an important one and one that will shape the rest of the year: **Start thinking big. Big and Fearless.** I'm tired of feeling like I drown in the details of life. 
* I did not make as much money this year as previous years. In general, I'm having a "is this where my career should be?" point in my life. As I approach 40, I'm getting too old to compete with college age consultants for building simple websites. But what else should I focus on doing? Hmmm...
* Take photos of all my friends in some sort of photo that represents them. In costumes. Staged. I really want a nice photo book at the end of the year with everyone I know. This requires some long term planning.
* Keep losing weight. I felt like I was on a good nutritional path before the holidays arrived. I can feel it's in my grasp. I just need to keep everything in focus and not get side-tracked. Keep up with my existing routine of lifting weights and running.
* Get my god-damned comic books on my website with donation links and places to buy printed issues. I was so close to get everything up a few months ago and then I got side-tracked. I'd love to do another issue, but without money to hire an artist, it's not going to happen. 
* Learn Spanish. Learning a little Mandarin was pretty painless (using Fluenz). As long as I give it an hour or two a week, I make progress. 
* It's time for more social outlets. I don't what this would be: a photography group, a gay rights group, a musical group...something.
* I bought t-shirt silk screening supplies over a year ago and I've never used them. Why not? It would be fun to be making my own t-shirts. It's not even that hard, I just need to get over the hump of making the first one.

These are some resolutions that I doubt will ever come to pass but are fun to think about:

* There is news that the Apple Tablet will be coming out soon. I think they will have a new format for printed materials delivered electronically. I'd like to learn that as quickly as possible and try to get in on comic publishing for electronic formats. 
* Start a NYC chapter of the Tea Party Movement (I'm only half-joking. This would be hysterical and I could write a book afterwards.)
* On a side note...chairmanswife.com and dearbartender.com are two URLs that I have that are expiring soon. Maybe I should finally do something with them. This past year I laughed at the notion of building a content website. Who would ever visit? Now I'm in a mindset that maybe I should just build it and not worry about the results so much. (Think big, Keith!)
* I had a thought when I was making chocolates this year. I could write a book about all the chocolates. I have recipes now for almost 20 chocolates, each with a flavor from a different part of the world. I could write a few pages about each of the places and their local flavors. I could have copious pictures of the process of making the chocolates. It would all make a cute little Christmas-y book to give to people.

Some updates...

I saw a book on developing your programming career from one of my favorite publishers. Perhaps I should read it and start putting into practice some techniques for growing my career. And on another side note, there's all of a sudden a lot of little work in my lap.

I went to meetup.com and looked for some groups to join. And so I joined the following:

* Gay Tech Meetup
* Queer Sangha 
* NYC Gay Men's Book Club
* Pin Up Studio Photography

I know it's a little gay-centric, but hey...I like the company of gay men. Meetings start this Sunday, Dec 27th, so I'll be 3 days ahead of schedule on completing these resolutions!&quot;;&quot;1261579513&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;I've Got Kitsch on the Brain&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/music/ive-got-kitsch-brain&quot;;&quot;Around 12-15 years ago, I discovered a mix tape that belonged to a friend of mine. The tape was called "Schlock Around the Clock" and it was a revelation. I don't think I recognized any of the music on it. It juxtaposed The Cramps with Eartha Kitt. It had movie clips spliced into the songs. I listened to it non-stop and it kicked off years of musical obsessions and CD hunting. 

I attempted to make my own version on CD. The first one is called "I've Got Kitsch on the Brain". It contains a handful of songs from the original mix tape and at least one of the movie trailers. It took me forever to track down the original trailer soundtrack from "Astro-Zombies". And I never found a digital copy of "Hot Dog Rock & Roll". I threw in some songs that just about everyone has heard to balance it all out.

I had some qualms about placing this on the internet. Yes, people used to make mix tapes for their friends all the time and no one thought anything of it. So what's the big deal if the mix tape is now in digital format? And what's the big deal if I can now immediately distribute this to ALL my friends instead of just some? To help me justify my guilt, why don't you throw some money at some of the artists on iTunes or Amazon? After all, we could probably all stand to beef up our Sergio Mendes collection. 

And finally, this music doesn't work well out of context. It's meant to be listened form start to finish - not randomly. And be sure that the files are marked for gapless playback. There are lots of fade ins and fade outs that don't work if there's a gap in playback.

Happy listening.

&quot;I've Got Kitsch in My Heart&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/music/ive-got-kitsch-my-heart&quot;;&quot;This was my second attempt at making a CD mix. I really felt like I hit my stride on this one. I borrowed lots of film clips "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" and "Blood Sucking Freaks". And the music is a bit more focused - clearly hitting more of the late 60's and 70's psychedelia.

Once upon a time, I had plans for a third one "I See Kitsch With My Third Eye" that would focus primarily on Bollywood music from the 60's and 70's. We'll see if that ever materializes.

&quot;Got Problems, Baby?&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/music/got-problems-baby&quot;;&quot;If you skipped my other CD mixes, fine. This is the one to download. One night I dragged Benji to see Coffy at the Film Forum - not really knowing what to expect. I was transfixed. It was hard-core, it was sexy, it was righteous revenge, it was ... Pam Grier. She's a better vigilante than Batman. If you haven't seen Coffy or Foxy Brown, you really should. I can honestly say that my sense of entertainment was altered when I saw Coffy.
<!--break-->
Listening to these clips recently, I don't think people today would be able to make these movies. In fact, I was really excited when I heard Quentin Tarantino was making Jackie Brown. However, it was unbelievably tame compared to her early films. There's a thirst for justice and revenge pumping through her original films. 

And besides the films, the music is incredible. I really don't even want to bother trying to explain why it's so great. Just listen to it.

So consider this mix a primer course in blaxploitation films. There are two discs. The highlight is track 9 on the second disc - transitioning from Marlena Shaw into one of my favorite clips from Coffy and then into "Treat Her Like a Lady". It scratches an itch I didn't know I had.

&quot;A Pomodoro in Time&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/nlp/pomodoro-time&quot;;&quot;I just finished reading a book called "Pomodoro Technique Illustrated" by Staffan Nöteberg (http://www.amazon.com/Pomodoro-Technique-Illustrated-Really-Minutes/dp/1934356506). I guess it's a little premature to say that it's changed my life, but in my first week of truly implementing the method, I find myself on Thursday and have already accomplished more than I had mentally apportioned to get done for the whole week. A couple of months ago, I had read the free PDF by the original author and decided to test it out, but in typical fashion I sort of did it half-ass. This particular book helped me understand much more why the technique works and modifies it somewhat so that it's inline with other time-management and productivity techniques.

For those that don't know the Pomodoro Technique, it's really simple. At it's core, you work in 25 minute increments. You set a timer, work uninterrupted for 25 minutes, then take a break for 5 minutes. You keep doing that and every 4 "pomodori", you take a longer break. And the thing is, you can't break up a pomodoro into smaller pieces. If someone interrupts you for more than a minute or so, you invalidate the entire pomodoro and start over. So you quickly learn the phrase "Respect the Pomodoro". You quickly learn to ignore the growing number of unread messages in your inbox. 

It was founded by an Italian student that felt like he was working all day and not accomplishing anything. In total frustration with his short attention span, he set a timer and said he was going to do one task for 25 minutes - just to see if it was possible.

I have tried to read other productivity books and they always come across a bit too much like a cult manifesto. And the techniques were just too complex. I always subconsciously knew I wasn't going to be able to modify my habits to the point where I would follow the technique. So one of the big benefit of the techinque is that it's simple, and the benefit of this book is that it's short. When you distill the book down to the actual technique, it's just a handful of pages. He spends the majority of the book talking about how our brains work and what they need to operate optimally. He takes a very matter-of-fact approach that is pretty rare among self-help books. 

A few times he talks about the contributing factors to procrastination and he does it in a simple, non-emotional way. I've seen books to help you deal with procrastination where they claim that you essentially need to generate an inner cheerleader - constantly firing you up to ACCOMPLISH THINGS. Nope. Doesn't work in my world. His description and prescription for procrastination fits my particular outlook much more clearly.

When I first read about the Pomodoro Technique, I thought that it was primarily centered around stopping disruptions. And it's definitely that, but I would argue that that's not the reason it works so well. Staffan talks a lot in the book about creating a rhythm for accomplishment. It's almost like you're training your attention span like a professional athlete trains in cycles. You're exercising your ability for productivity. The cycle of 25 minutes on and 5 minutes off puts you into a buzz of focus. 

On software projects, there's always a big push at the end. I'm clear-headed, driven, and I'm crossing everything off my to-do list at a lightning pace. I often thought "I wish I could start every day like this and not just close to the deadline." And I think we tend to convince ourselves that we have to wait for the muse to strike or the adrenaline to kick in before we can really accomplish something substantial. Following the technique allows you to tap into that energy as soon as you set the timer. As soon as I wind up the timer, I feel like I'm on the bonus round of "The $25,000 Pyramid."

And finally, it has shed a big light on my time estimates. When I first read the free PDF, I had no interest in recording my estimates. I just wanted to set the timer and go. After reading Staffan's book, I realized that the time estimates, review and analysis was crucial. It's a real eye-opener to see how I wildly under-estimate certain tasks.

Anyway, I don't want to go on and on or it will sound like I'm evangelizing. I highly recommend the book. You'll start using the Pomodoro Technique for everything: 25 minutes to clean the kitchen. Go. 25 minutes to organize my desk. Go. 

FYI - It took me two pomodori for this blog post.

&quot;Quince Branches&quot;;&quot;personal/house/kitchen/quince-branches&quot;;&quot;For David's 50th, our good friends Maria & Michael sent us some quince branches. I had never heard of keeping quince branches as a cut flower, but they have turned out to be beautiful.

At first I was a bit intimidated by the size. There were about 5-6 branches and they were 6 feet tall. We didn't have a vase big enough to hold them. I went to our local high-end florist who got us a vase and cut the ends for us - both cutting off the tips and splitting the bottoms to help them absorb water. 

Yesterday they started blooming all over. I took some pictures of them in the light of the snowstorm. 

Supposedly they will last until spring. I'm so impressed with them that I will have to add them to my list of great gifts to deliver to people.

&quot;Sis & Lorenz Visit NYC&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/lorenz/sis-lorenz-visit-nyc&quot;;&quot;I just said goodbye to Sis and Lorenz. David was kind enough to use his miles to purchase tickets for Sis and Lorenz for a little winter visit. Looking back on it, it's hard to believe that it was just over two days. I'm surprised Lorenz' head didn't burst after all the activities we threw his way.
<!--break-->
They arrived on a Saturday night. Lorenz crashed in the cab ride form the airport and stayed comatose while we caught up with Sis. The next morning, after breakfast, David and I took him to Union Square to play in the park. We gave him the first of his birthday presents: a Fujifilm Instax 210. We told him that it only worked outdoors to help motivate him to leave the house and also to keep it a novelty. There's really just one thing to do: press a button and take a picture. He kept wanting to take pictures of the ground. He got the hang of it and took some really great photos. Of the photos below, there are only two he didn't take. 

The rest of that day was largely dedicated to making homemade donuts. Sis had invited some friends over to help eat everything. I was a bit overwhelmed at first, but soon got myself in the rhythm of cranking out donuts: vanilla glazed, cinnamon donut holes, and maple bars. I wish I could make donuts more often, but they just don't fit into a healthy diet. 

That afternoon, Lorenz and I spent some quality time playing Lego Star Wars on my PS3. I don't really understand what it means to be 4 years old. He had a hard time understanding the controls and often got too carried away to even work the controls. I tried to keep the video games to a minimum, because it overloaded his system.

For dinner that night, we made use of a present that David got for his birthday: a very nice fondue set. I had gone to Artisanal earlier in the week and got a variety of Swiss cheeses. It was my first time making a fondue, but it's not that hard - especially with really great ingredients. Surprisingly, Lorenz was not into the fondue, which was fine since the adults were all having a great time.

The next day was a big day. We took Lorenz to Hayden Planetarium. I was blown away. The show was fantastic. I forget that I live in NYC sometimes, and that living in NYC means you get the very best. The show, with a voice-over by Whoopi Goldberg, was light years beyond the planetarium shows I had seen as a kid. And I think it's one of those shows that you appreciate more the older you get.

After the planetarium, we wandered through the Museum of Natural History. Lorenz went cuh-razy looking at all the dinosaur bones. And there were so many more exhibits than I remembered. I would have enjoyed staying and looking at some of the more boring exhibits, but we were constantly flirting with (or managing) meltdowns, so short-circuited trip and took him to the whale room. He was in total heaven in the whale room. I think just the calming dark blue light helped significantly. 

As we approached the whale room, and he was looking at the hundreds of animals on the walls and ceiling, you could almost see his brain short-circuiting. As an adult, I know when I'm hitting overload time. I know when it's all getting to be too much and I need to sit and let everything sink in. A child doesn't know how to do that though. I don't know how they compensate. Do they start ejecting information that they can't process?

We got one last look at dinosaur bones and then got back on the subway to head downtown. He was having a hard time not being really cranky, and I was tempted to go straight home, but instead we took him to Max Brenner. It was a madhouse, but he was instantly transfixed by all the chocolate. Everyone got something to take out and we walked home. 

Most of us crashed except for Sis and Lorenz (I don't know why Sis hasn't instituted nap-time, but oh well). Dinner was relatively simple. 

This morning was pretty low-key. I think Lorenz was starting to break down from being away from home. He was pretty cranky in the morning. I gave him his final present, an iPod Nano loaded with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck cartoons. He loved it and didn't want to put it away when it was time to go. However, I think he knew that the weekend had been too much. He wanted to go home. 

Here are some of the better Instax photos:

&quot;The Hardest Work Out of My Life (thus far)&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/fitness/hardest-work-out-my-life-thus-far&quot;;&quot;I took a new fitness class today. It was recommended to me by a friend. It's a gym that is only a block or two from my house called AeroSpace NYC (http://aerospacenyc.com). To be honest, I've been meaning to go for months. And this week I finally put my foot down with myself and said I had to go. And even then, I chickened out twice when I got to the front doors. Looking back on it, I have no idea why I was so stressed out about attending. I would have no problems going back - in fact, I'm currently planning to quit my regular gym and just go here.

The gym does not have any weights or machines. It's primarily for classes, though it appears there are some private sessions there as well. The gym centers around boxing fitness. The owner is a former professional boxer. I don’t have any desire to box, but the classes sounded very intense with a low risk of injury. The classes focus on either boxing moves (doing punch and jab sequences), rope jumping, or toning using weighted bars or small dumbbells. The big inspiration is the owner, who is lean, strong, and fast.

The main part of my intimidation was the fact that most classes have some sort of jumping rope. I had a trainer in my 20’s try to get me to jump rope and it was not fun. Even if I had the coordination, within 30 seconds of successful jumping, I’m ready to heave up a lung. One of the times I had chicken out, I arrived to see a class all jumping rope in perfect unison. They were doing various foot sequences in harmony just to cement their “we’re doing something you can only dream of” status.

And the other part of my intimidation is that it’s New York. It seems like whenever you try to learn something new in NYC, you have to do it with people that have been doing that exact thing for 10 years and are pretty damn alpha about it. I really, really, really didn’t feel like being The Out-Of-Shape Guy in the back while everyone breezes through the workout.

As I raised these concerns to the friend that told me I should go, he kept saying “It’s not like that. Just go. No one can keep up. It’s okay.”

And why I didn’t believe him, I’ll never know.

The instructor/owner could not have been nicer. He came up to me before the class and introduced himself. He said that I should not try any footwork for jumping rope - just do the basics and never do more than 8 in a row until I get more comfortable. He also said that for the lunges and squats, I should make the movement as small as possible until my body says it’s ready for me. So all in all, I felt pretty good.

But what really put me at ease, was the guy in the center of the front row. He was in perfect condition - one of these hardcore Chelsea fitness buffs. And he looked like he had taken the class many times before. As we started warming up (which was quite a warm-up), he had to stop twice to recover. Within 3 minutes of the class starting, my ribs were aching and I was out of breath. I had no idea it would go that hard that quickly. 

After Mr. Perfect in the front row had to stop to recover, I noticed lots of other people having to stop for a few seconds to catch their breath. And it was like that the whole class. Not a single person could follow everything. People took breathers liberally. All of a sudden I relaxed and had more fun. I had no problems taking a breather for a minute and then throwing myself back in the thick of it. 

My rope jumping was not so bad. My punching was pretty good, but the instructor came over and corrected me from hyper-extending. I took a water break about 20 minutes into the class. At the 40 minute mark, I was seriously seeing stars. Even the abs section of the class - though very brief - was so intense that I could only do about 4-5 of each exercise. I’ve heard that with perseverance, you can get through the whole class without stopping. I can’t even fathom what sort of shape you have to be in for that. 

What amazed me most about the instructor was his speed and agility. The punching sequences were a real wake-up call. I kept thinking that when we would start a punching sequence, that it wouldn’t be as hard as the rope jumping - but I eventually started praying for more rope jumping. I have no idea how you make all those movements for the punch sequences as fast as he does it. And I just didn’t have the mental acuity in the workout to keep doing it. Every now and then, my brain would short circuit and I’d look like a spastic muppet - limbs flailing randomly.

So, I finished. And yes, I’ve never felt so old, slow and out-of-shape in my life. But damn it was a good workout. The owner came by afterwards to shake my hand and compliment me on my jumping. I left with a feeling of “well, how could I _not_ continue?” &quot;;&quot;1266618841&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Fondue&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/main-dishes/fondue&quot;;&quot;Ah... fondue. It has the reputation of being hopelessly 70's. David recently received a fondue set for his birthday. How we had gone all this time without a fondue set is beyond me. I've made fondue twice with it now, and the second round was so good, that I had to tell myself to not get into a fondue frenzy - it was going to start doing damage to my waistline.

I get my cheeses from Artisanal. You can order some of them from Fresh Direct. And Whole Foods has a pretty good selection as well. Maybe one of these days I will wander down to Murray's Cheeses for a selection. I think it's good to be a little experimental with the cheese selection.

<ul>
<li>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper, 1 clove garlic
<li>1 cup white wine
<li>2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
<li>6 ounces Gruyère cheese, grated
<li>6 ounces Emmental cheese, grated
<li>6 ounces Appenzell cheese, grated
<li>6 ounces Jarlsberg (or Hoch Ybrig or Beaufort if you can get it) cheese, grated
<li>4 teaspoons cornstarch
<li>Crusty bread, cubed, for serving
<li>Boiled fingerling potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, or mushrooms, for serving (optional)
</ul>

Sprinkle fondue pot or a 2-quart saucepan with salt. Vigorously rub the inside of the pot with garlic; and discard. Add the wine and lemon juice, and bring to a boil over medium heat.

In a medium bowl, stir to combine the cheeses and cornstarch. While whisking constantly, add the cheese mixture in four additions. Be sure each addition is completely melted before adding the next addition. Once all of the cheese has been added, cook for 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, and serve immediately with bread, potatoes, or vegetables, as desired.&quot;;&quot;1267374353&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;No More Store Bought Dog Food&quot;;&quot;no-more-store-bought-dog-food&quot;;&quot;After Oz&#39;s pancreatitis, I&#39;ve decided that it&#39;s not enough that I&#39;m buying healthy, raw dog food. I thought I was making good choices for him, but it comes down to the fact that when it&#39;s made by someone else, you don&#39;t really know what goes into it. I want to know and be responsible for absolutely everything he eats. I read through the section of Dr. Pitcairn&#39;s book on pancreatitis and he listed some foods that aid digestion and the pancreas. So I&#39;m going back to making the dogs&#39; food from scratch. That way I can pick exactly what he needs and make sure he gets human-grade meat. (Really, I should have known better than to trust packaged food after that whole melamine pet food scare from a few years ago.)

And in addition to making their regular food, I&#39;m going to start making their treats from scratch, too. I found a bunch of recipes online: <a href="http://www.dogaware.com/diet/treats.html">http://www.dogaware.com/diet/treats.html</a>. I&#39;m not really looking forward to having the whole house smell like liver and garlic, but so be it. I&#39;ll start small on the batches until I&#39;m sure they like they taste and then start making bulk.

Once I get into the rhythm of making food for the dogs, I&#39;m going to tackle David and myself next. It would be great to never order out for meals again.&quot;;&quot;1280072649&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;So many ways to stay connected&quot;;&quot;so-many-ways-stay-connected&quot;;&quot;<div class='posterous_autopost'>I&#39;m putting together an exit strategy for Facebook. I love the fact that I&#39;m contact with smart, fun people that I rarely get to see. Unfortunately, the constant privacy concerns are...concerning me. I tried Twitter for many months, but the 140 character limit really gets to me sometimes. And I have been unable to get TweetDeck truly integrated into my weekly routine, so Twitter has fallen by the wayside. I tried Tumblr, which I ay still fall back on, but it updates Facebook in an odd way.  <p /><div>So now I&#39;m trying Posterous. Which is designed to be the ultimate tool for updating your various feeds everywhere. We&#39;ll see if it&#39;s a decent payoff.</div></div>&quot;;&quot;1280072719&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Saw "The Kids Are Alright"&quot;;&quot;saw-kids-are-alright&quot;;&quot;...and it&#39;s a really great movie. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m so bogged down with Oz&#39;s recovery or bogged down by the mugginess of NYC right now, but I immediately thought \&quot;I want to move to California and raise kids\&quot;. I&#39;ve had moments in my life where those two thoughts came and went pretty quickly - usually separately. But this was the first time in my life that the idea of having kids actually felt like a good idea. I could see it all and play it out roughly in my head and it felt...doable. It felt right. It resonated with me. I have to not focus on the first 5 years which seems like an unending terror of diapers and crying. Everything after that seems like it would be pretty amazing - rocky, of course, but still like something that challenges you, makes you grow, and allows you to see more of how life works. And to have a family, of course.

And on a side note, I remember my Mom got misty when she dropped me off at college. How did she not bawl her eyes out? Did she cry all the way back to Oregon? Because just watching the movie, I don&#39;t think I would have any emotional fortitude at that moment in my life.

And California...ah, California. I was ready to pack up and go within the first few shots of sunny California. Man, living in NYC is <b>hard</b> sometimes. I feel like I&#39;m always fighting crowds or weather or strangers or just the city itself. And as I said, this probably has more to do with Oz&#39;s recovery which is weighing pretty heavily on me right now. And the painters in the house. And work. And the constant heat waves. But in all the outdoor shots I could smell California - the eucalyptus, the fresh produce...ah. Maybe someday. 

Anyway, the movie is really fantastic and feels so authentic. The acting is top notch all around. I recommend it to all adults.&quot;;&quot;1280074514&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;

&quot;Green Tripe to the Rescue&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/oz/green-tripe-rescue&quot;;&quot;The big hurdle in Oz's recovery has been getting him to eat. The doctors initially warned us about not trying to feed him too much too quickly. In hindsight, that seems laughable that we were concerned about him eating too much. Some days it's better than others and he goes for it, but usually it's a few nibbles and he loses interest.

So I decided to pull out the big guns and order green tripe. For those of you that have never heard of it, tripe is one of the later stomachs of animals that chew their cud (in this case, cows). There's even a website about it: http://www.greentripe.com/. Green tripe refers to tripe that has not been cleaned of contents. In other words, it's animal intestines filled with partially digested food. Yummers! It's supposed to be very good for their digestive system because it has all sorts of enzymes that their bodies can't produce. 

It's illegal to sell to humans, but you can sell it to dogs. And I had heard stories of people that had fed it to their dogs. Step #1: put a clothespin over your nose. Step #2: give the green tripe to your dog. Step #3: Watch your dog go insane with happiness.

I ordered green tripe from Oma's Pride (http://www.omaspride.com/) along with many other disgusting and hard-to-find animal items. I had been holding on to it until Oz was a bit more on the mend, but this morning he was barely eating. He had a few bites of the canned food that the vet gave us. He turned his nose up to everything else I had. So I pulled out the tripe. 

Yes, it smells like manure. It was still partially frozen so the smell wasn't that bad. For half a second, I thought of defrosting it in the microwave, but I think David would have run screaming out of the house if the whole kitchen reeked of microwaved manure. I pulled out the mostly defrosted parts into Oz's bowl and quickly sealed up the remainder. 

When I put it down for Oz, there was a tentative sniff. My lips were still curled into a sneer from the smell. Then he gave it a tentative lick. Then he started eating voraciously. He went through two servings and still asked for a third. It was more than he had eaten in days. He lost his appetite at the beginning of the third helping, so Gogo got the rest. She did the same tentative sniff and then went crazy. They licked the bowl spotless. 

It's pretty clear that I'm going to have to order more for them. I'm hoping that it does indeed have a great effect on his digestive system which has had quite a blow over the past couple of weeks.&quot;;&quot;1280592690&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;I'm obsessed with pre-fab mini homes&quot;;&quot;personal/blog/living/im-obsessed-pre-fab-mini-homes&quot;;&quot;Perhaps it was all the news footage of Chelsea Clinton's wedding, but I have become obsessed with the notion of getting a mini pre-fab home in the country. Sara had shown me this site a while ago: http://www.weehouse.com and I can't stop looking at the images. A little house upstate to retreat to...ahh...sounds perfect. 

Now I need to figure out where I'm going to get the money for such a house.

My favorites are the McGlasson and the Marfa, by the way.&quot;;&quot;1280757450&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Packing for China&quot;;&quot;china/packing-china&quot;;&quot;I'm packing for China now. Well, at least I should be packing instead of writing blog posts. 

David had bought tickets in coach flying non-stop from Chicago to Beijing. I was not looking forward to that flight. The good news is that we got upgraded from coach to business! Yippee! And I have 28 hours of video on my iPad and enough Ambien to remain serene, sleepy, and entertained.

So now...what am I doing in China? I was on my won for five days in Beijing last year and I went over board as a tourist. I had crossed everything off my list from temples, to parks, to Peking Opera, to markets, to crazy Chinese medical treatments. I was even one ahead of David on the list of Wonders of the World because I made it to the Great Wall of China before he did. So I naively thought that I would repeat a lot of my successes from the past trip and take David around to my highlights of last year. Foolish Keith. I found a whole new slew ofthings to do:

*The Great Wall of China and Ming Tombs* - Yes, this is a repeat, but David has to see the Great Wall. Also, my tour guide gave me a terrible tour of the Ming Tombs so I feel like I have to go back. I don't think I even saw half of them. I never even went inside the actual tombs.

*Tour of Buddhist Temples* - We found a gay guide that suggested this tour. I had been to the Lama Temple and it's stunning. I'm happy to go back. I'm also happy that there are 7 other temples our guide will be taking us to.

*Moxibustion* - This will be part of my visit to a Chinese health clinic. I'll let this page explain it: http://acupuncturetoday.com/abc/moxibustion.php. The practitioner is also going to give me a "food energetics" session which will outline what sorts of foods I should be eating and which ones to stay away from to "remove the damp from my system" and promote the flow of Qi.

*The Museum of Ethnic Clothes* - This looks a great museum of old textiles and clothes from China.

*Cooking Class* - I'm not 100% sold on this one, but I may attend a class (spoken in English) on traditional Chinese home cooking. I was hoping for a hand made noodle pulling class, but I'm too late for that one.

So I feel like I'm ready to attack Beijing again like a rabid tourist, hungry for new experiences. And I'm with David this time, so I will have better meals than last time. 

FYI - I never got around to posting the photos from my trip to China last year, so at some point you can expect to see a whole mess of China photos on the site.&quot;;&quot;1284909954&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;The Hotel is Really, Really Nice&quot;;&quot;china/hotel-really-really-nice&quot;;&quot;So...David and I had a nice flight to China. It went by really quickly for some reason. I'm sure that being in business class helped. And now it's 1am, we're settled into our hotel, and we're wide awake.

We're staying the Hilton Beijing Wangfujing. We had some problems getting here. Specifically, the taxi driver had no idea where it was and didn't speak English. The Google maps that we had printed up helped marginally. Pointing and shouting "zhe ge" also helped.

The hotel is possibly the fanciest place I've ever stayed. We got upgraded to a suite. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that there aren't that many people staying here. 

The room is full of mirrors and glass panels. I can't tell when I'm walking into a new space or when I'm about to crash into a mirrored wall. They had three tiers of sweets on the coffee table: chocolates, chocolate covered cherries, and macaroons. They offered to have someone come to the room to massage our legs (I don't even want to know if that was code for something). But the pièce de résistance is that they had a teddy bear on the bed waiting for us. A TEDDY BEAR! I'm tempted to see if there's a "read me a bed-time story" service.

And of course, the usual social networking rules apply in China: no Facebook, no Twitter, no ping.fm. So my little site will have to handle all those duties for me. &quot;;&quot;1285002954&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
&quot;Doodhi Chana Dal&quot;;&quot;personal/recipes/dish/side-dishes/doodhi-chana-dal&quot;;&quot;This is a typical dish from Gujarat and is a staple food for farmers in that region. There are many types of pumpkin, but the ones available in the Indian grocery stores are called "Iauki" or "doodhi." This dish is absolutely delicious eaten plain with chapattis.

1 pound pumpkin or winter squash
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
pinch of asafoetida
1 teaspoon sugar
1 onion, sliced
2 1/2 cups dried chickpeas, soaked overnight and drained
3 tablespoons canned chopped tomatoes with juice
1 tablespoon red chile paste
2 teaspoons fresh grated ginger
2 garlic cloves mashed
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt, to taste
chopped fresh cilantro, to garnish

Peel the pumpkin or squash and cut into 2-inch cubes. Coat the cubes olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Roast the squash in an oven at 400º for 30 minutes, or until the edges start to turn brown.

Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan and add the mustard seeds. When they start to "pop," add the asafoetida, sugar, and onion and cook until the onion browns slightly. Add the chickpeas and tomatoes, cover, and cook for about 10 minutes.

Add the chili paste, garlic, ginger, ground turmeric, squash, and 2/3 cup water, cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes longer.

Serve hot with rice or bread.&quot;;&quot;1291069905&quot;;&quot;textile&quot;
